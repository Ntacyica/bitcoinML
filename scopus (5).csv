The models are validated in a period characterized by unprecedented turmoil and tested in a period of bear markets, allowing the assessment of whether the predictions are good even when the market direction changes between the validation and test periods. The classification and regression methods use attributes from trading and network activity for the period from August 15, 2015 to March 03, 2019, with the test sample beginning on April 13, 2018. For the test period, five out of 18 individual models have success rates of less than 50%. The trading strategies are built on model assembling. The ensemble assuming that five models produce identical signals (Ensemble 5) achieves the best performance for ethereum and litecoin, with annualized Sharpe ratios of 80.17% and 91.35% and annualized returns (after proportional round-trip trading costs of 0.5%) of 9.62% and 5.73%, respectively. These positive results support the claim that machine learning provides robust techniques for exploring the predictability of cryptocurrencies and for devising profitable trading strategies in these markets, even under adverse market conditions. © 2021, The Author(s).","Bitcoin; Ethereum; Forecasting; Litecoin; Machine learning; Trading","UIDB/05037/2020

It is a decentralized and unreliably distributed database technology. Numerous countries and researchers have successively applied blockchain in various fields. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were adopted as bibliometric analysis tools in this paper to obtain a comprehensive overview of blockchain technology and grasp the current research emphasis. The Web of Science core collection database was used as the primary source for data collection. The data were collected from 3826 articles published from 2013 to 2020. Specifically, the publication trends and categories might throw light on the development trends and current domains in terms of blockchain research. The most influential and productive authors, institutions, countries, and journals were involved in this bibliometric analysis. Theoretical knowledge and hot research topics on blockchain mainly ranged over “smart contract”, “bitcoin”, “security”, “ethereum”, and “cryptography”. A cluster analysis from the keyword perspective was carried out to obtain emerging trends and frontiers of blockchain. The results showed that future research should concentrate on management, blockchain technology, energy, machine learning, and smart home. Therefore, this paper assisted scholars and practitioners in getting a comprehensive understanding of the status quo and trends of blockchain research. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bibliometric analysis; Blockchain; CiteSpace; VOSviewer","B19005

Some studies have used traditional statistical and econometric methods to understand the economic and technology determinants of Bitcoin, few have considered the development of predictive models using these determinants. In this study, we developed a two-stage approach for exploring whether the information hidden in economic and technology determinants can accurately predict the Bitcoin exchange rate. In the first stage, two nonlinear feature selection methods comprising an artificial neural network and random forest are used to reduce the subset of potential predictors by measuring the importance of economic and technology factors. In the second stage, the potential predictors are integrated into long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the Bitcoin exchange rate regardless of the previous exchange rate. Our results showed that by using the economic and technology determinants, LSTM could achieve better predictive performance than the autoregressive integrated moving average, support vector regression, adaptive network fuzzy inference system, and LSTM methods, which all use the previous exchange rate. Thus, information obtained from economic and technology determinants is more important for predicting the Bitcoin exchange rate than the previous exchange rate. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters","Bitcoin; Exchange rate; Long short-term memory; Machine learning; Prediction","71720107002

In this paper, we have attempted to predict bitcoin value by taking into consideration various features that may affect its price. The amount of cryptocurrency in circulation, the volume of cryptocurrency exchanged in a day and the demand for cryptocurrency are a few of the factors that influence its cost. The forecasting is done using different time series analysis techniques like moving average, ARIMA and machine learning algorithms including SVM, linear regression, LSTM and GRU.

This paper aims to help traders decide how to best act by creating a model that can predict price movement's direction for the next 5-min time frame. Several machine-learning models have been tested for this Up/Down binary-classification problem. In this paper, we provide a comparison of the state-of-art strategies in predicting the movement direction for bitcoin, including Random Guessing and a Momentum-Based Strategy. The tested models include Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Prophet (by Facebook), Random Forest, Random Forest Lagged-Auto-Regression, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Networks. The MLP deep neural network has achieved the highest accuracy of 54% compared to other time-series prediction models.

For traders, Bitcoin leads to a promising investment because of its highly fluctuating price. Block chain technology assists in the transactions of documentation. The characteristics of the bitcoin which is derived from the blockchain technology has led to diverse interests in the field of economics. The bitcoin data is selected from 2013 to 2018, over a period of 5 years for this analysis. Here a new roll over technology is applied where new data is obtained over time which will close out the old information during machine training. This mechanism will help in incorporating new information in the short-term learning. The results show that the rollover mechanism improves the time series prediction accuracy. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.","Bitcoin; Price prediction; Roll over mechanism; Time series analysis",,"https://www.statista.com/statistics/326707/bitcoin-price-index/; Lane, ND, Bhattacharya, S, Georgiev, P, Forlivesi, C, Kawsar, F, An early resource characterization of deep learning on wearables, smartphones and internet-of-things devices (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 international workshop on internet of things towards applications— IoT-App 15; Spuler, M, Sarasola-Sanz, A, Birbaumer, N, Rosenstiel, W, Ramos-Murguialday, A, Comparing metrics to evaluate performance of regression methods for decoding of neural signals (2015) 37th Annual international conference of the IEEE engineering in medicine and biology society (EMBC); Ahmed, NK, Atiya, AF, Gayar, NE, El-Shishiny, H, (2015) An empirical comparison of machine learning models for time series forecasting, , Technical Report; Veerakumar, S, Dhanya, NM, Performance analysis of various regression algorithms for time series temperature prediction (2018) J Adv Res Dyn Control Syst, 10 (3), pp. 996-1000; Anufriev, M, Hommes, C, Makarewicz, T, (2012) Learning to forecast with genetic algorithms, , Working Paper; Khadka, M, Popp, B, George, KM, Park, N, A new approach for time series forecasting based on genetic algorithm (2010) CAINE, pp. 226-231; Jang, H, Lee, J, An empirical study on modeling and prediction of bitcoin prices with bayesian neural networks based on blockchain information (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 5427-5437; Li, L, Arab, A, Liu, J, Liu, J, Han, Z, Bitcoin options pricing using LSTM-based prediction model and blockchain statistics (2019) 2019 IEEE international conference on Blockchain (Blockchain); Dhanya, NM, Harish, UC, Sentiment analysis of twitter data on demonetization using machine learning techniques (2018) Lecture notes in computational vision and biomechanics, 28, pp. 227-237; Sriwiji, R, Primandari, AH, An empirical study in forecasting bitcoin price using bayesian regularization neural network (2020) Proceedings of the 1st international conference on statistics and analytics, ICSA 2019, , 2–3 Aug 2019, Bogor, Indonesia; Sin, E, Wang, L, Bitcoin price prediction using ensembles of neural networks (2017) 2017 13th International conference on natural computation, fuzzy systems and knowledge discovery (ICNC-FSKD); https://www.kaggle.com/c/bitcoin/data, Kaggle; Dobslaw, F, A parameter tuning framework for metaheuristics based on design of experiments and artifcial neural networks (2010) Proceedings of the international conference on computer mathematics and natural computing (WASET ’10); https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-algorithm-choice, http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation","Dhanya, N.M.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, India; email: nm_dhanya@cb.amrita.edu","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","English",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus

This paper investigates the untrusted users of cryptocurrency transaction services, which are connected using smartphones and computers. However, as technology is increasing, transaction frauds are growing, and there is a need to detect vulnerabilities in systems. A methodology is proposed to identify suspicious users based on their reputation score by collaborating centrality measures and machine learning techniques. The results are validated on two cryptocurrencies network datasets, Bitcoin-OTC, and Bitcoin-Alpha, which contain information of the system formed by the users and the user’s trust score. Results found that the proposed approach provides improved and accurate results. Hence, the fusion of machine learning with centrality measures provides a highly robust system and can be adapted to prevent smart devices’ financial services.

We measure market liquidity as the log rates of bid-ask spreads in a sample of three cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple) and 16 major fiat currencies from 9 February 2018 to 8 February 2019. We find that the KNN approach is better suited for capturing the market liquidity in a cryptocurrency in the short-term than the ARMA and GARCH models maybe due to the complexity of the microstructure of the market. Considering traditional time series models, we find that ARMA models perform well when estimating the liquidity of fiat currencies in developed markets, whereas GARCH models do the same for fiat currencies in emerging markets. Nevertheless, our results show that the KNN approach can better predict the log rates of the bid-ask spreads of crypto and fiat currencies than ARMA and GARCH models. © 2020 by the authors.

This has led to a renewal of interest in digital currencies. Cryptocurrency one of the most prominent digital currency has found itself in spotlight with investors wanting a piece of it and business establishments accepting it as a source of payment due to its stable performance in the last few years. This research has been done on predicting cryptocurrency prices using machine learning based neural network which has a lowest the model loss over 100 epochs during training and Technical Trade Indicators (TTI) graphs depicts a real BTC value 5 to 10 times in 300-days of current fiscal year has further supported this increasing trader confidence and a shift in global cryptocurrency graph by predicted BTC values. On the same lines, we are analyzing bitcoin prices using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis. We also study stock market trends in order to better predict bitcoin prices quantitively. In this work we analyze the impact of global currencies like US Dollar, foreign exchanges on Bitcoin prices and whether Bitcoin has the stability to dethrone global currencies and become the single medium of transaction. This work is adequate enough to aid in predicting price and with results obtained from predicting Bitcoin prices using machine learning based neural network achieving an accuracy of 94.89% under all circumstances of technical trade indication thereby bringing down its price prediction by over 13.7% in April 2020 itself during evaluation. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; economics; machine learning; neural network; prediction; technical trade",,"Calès, L., Chalkis, A., Emiris, I.Z., Fisikopoulos, V., Practical volume computation of structured convex bodies, and an application to modeling portfolio dependencies and financial crises (2018) Proc.

Notably, without any involvement from third party authorities, blockchain offers a decentralized consensus scheme to process user transactions, fund transfer, and various data records in a secure and reliable way. Furthermore, bitcoin price forecasting has been a vital research trend, where machine learning techniques play a substantial role. A sophisticated and appropriately trained model can be useless if the features being tested are unreliable. Independently, one of the most desirable aspects of a system that utilizes the blockchain is the concrete objectiveness by which each entry is cataloged. Any data collected and reported on the blockchain is unambiguous, and therefore, extremely suitable for a machine learning algorithm.

It brought a new paradigm that helps in the existence of the cryptocurrency and eliminating the third party in a financial transaction. It has the potential of optimising, enhancing streamlining many processes outside the cryptocurrency and financial sector but the adoption of the technology is limited by the hindering performance issues. These issues are mostly around the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol that is used by Bitcoin and Ethereum and referred to as the most secured and decentralised protocol thus, the most reliable. Unfortunately, the protocol suffers a performance degrade with the increasing size and number of transactions because of its complexity. Many industries, researchers and organisation have been working on addressing these issues but most of the attempts result in facing another issue referred to as the scalability issue; having to trade off one of security or decentralisation to get speed. Other solution such as Bitcoin lighting network improved the transaction throughput of the Bitcoin without technically addressing the issue on the blockchain, therefore, didn't face the scalability issue. This paper presents a research work of a novel approach that propose using machine learning techniques to improve the performance by enhancing the mining efficiency of the protocol. It uses the Ethereum network as a case study. The paper also aims to compare the predictive accuracy and speed of some machine learning regression models against the traditional mining method starting from the Linear regression. The objective is to determine whether using machine learning in the mining process offers a faster way of achieving consensus, therefore improving performance by reducing the time and energy consumption of the protocol without sacrificing security or decentralisation. The proposed model results in improved accuracy and faster consensus from the early experiments. © 2020 IEEE.","Blockchain; Consensus protocol; Ethereum; Machine Learning; Proof-of-work",,"Gao, W., Hatcher, W.G., Yu, W., A survey of blockchain: Techniques, applications, and challenges (2018) 2018 27th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN), pp. 1-11; Zheng, Z., Xie, S., Dai, H.-N., Chen, X., Wang, H., Blockchain challenges and opportunities: A survey (2017) International Journal of Web and Grid Services, , apr; Krawiec, R.J., Housman, D., White, M., Filipova, M., Quarre, F., Barr, D., Nesbitt, A., Tsai, L., (2016) Blockchain: Opportunities for Health Care, p. 14. , https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/publicsector/articles/blockchain-opportunities-for-health-care.html, ComputerWeekly. com; Mendling, J., Weber, I., Aalst, W.M.P., Vom Brocke, J., Cabanillas, C., Daniel, F., Debois, S., Zhu, L., Blockchains for business process management-challenges and opportunities (2018) ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems, , In press, apr; Al-Jaroodi, J., Mohamed, N., Blockchain in industries: A survey (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 36500-36515; Fanning, K., Centers, D.P., Blockchain and its coming impact on financial services (2016) Journal of Corporate Accounting & Finance, 27 (5), pp. 53-57. , https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jcaf.22179; Lu, Y., The blockchain: State-of-the-art and research challenges (2019) Journal of Industrial Information Integration, 15, pp. 80-90. , January; Aste, T., Tasca, P., Matteo, T.D., Blockchain technologies: The foreseeable impact on society and industry (2017) Computer, 50 (9), pp. 18-28. , https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8048633; Yu, Y., Liang, R., Xu, J., A scalable and extensible blockchain architecture (2018) 2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW), pp. 161-163; Chauhan, A., Malviya, O.P., Verma, M., Mor, T.S., Blockchain and scalability (2018) 2018 IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security Companion (QRS-C), pp. 122-128; Kim, S., Kwon, Y., Cho, S., A survey of scalability solutions on blockchain (2018) 2018 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC), pp. 1204-1207; Puthal, D., Malik, N., Mohanty, S.P., Kougianos, E., Das, G., Everything you wanted to know about the blockchain: Its promise, components, processes, and problems (2018) IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine, 7 (4), pp. 6-14; Bez, M., Fornari, G., Vardanega, T., The scalability challenge of ethereum: An initial quantitative analysis (2019) Proceedings-13th IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented System Engineering, SOSE 2019, 10th International Workshop on Joint Cloud Computing, JCC 2019 and 2019 IEEE International Workshop on Cloud Computing in Robotic Systems, CCRS 2019, pp. 167-176; Yli-Huumo, J., Ko, D., Choi, S., Park, S., Smolander, K., Where is current research on blockchain technology?a systematic review (2016) PLOS ONE, 11 (10), p. 0163477. , http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0163477; Ren, Z., Cong, K., Aerts, T., De Jonge, B., Morais, A., Erkin, Z., A scale-out blockchain for value transfer with spontaneous sharding (2018) 2018 Crypto Valley Conference on Blockchain Technology (CVCBT), pp. 1-10; Luu, L., Narayanan, V., Zheng, C., Baweja, K., Gilbert, S., Saxena, P., A secure sharding protocol for open blockchains (2016) Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, 24, pp. 17-30. , 28-October-2016; Mechkaroska, D., Dimitrova, V., Popovska-Mitrovikj, A., Analysis of the possibilities for improvement of blockchain technology (2018) 2018 26th Telecommunications Forum (TELFOR), pp. 1-4; Network, R., Raiden Network (RDN) High Volume, Instant and Secure Token Transfer without the Need for Global Consensus, , Tech.

This paper starts with a background of blockchains. We give some principal concepts of this new technology. Then we deal with machine learning as intelligent techniques that may be used for analyzing huge datasets and detecting eventual malicious transactions that can be occured in the untrusted network. We show the importance of such intelligent techniques when combining together to make good decisions in banking and finance. Our idea is applied to the Bitcoin system where the public Elliptic dataset from Kaggle is used as a benchmark. Since the latter is not all labeled, we use the k-means algorithm to partition the unlabeled data into two main clusters while the labeled data are moved to their corresponding clusters. Then, four machine learning techniques are used to classify all the data. The proposed system shows promising results in particular when combining k-means with the random forest classifier. © 2020 IEEE.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Elliptic dataset; k-means; machine learning",,"Abellan, J., Mantas, C.J., Improving experimental studies about ensembles of classifiers for bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring (2014) Expert Systems with Applications, 41, pp. 3825-3830; Angrish, A., Craver, B., Hasan, M., Starly, B., A case study for blockchain in manufacturing (2018) FabRec : A Prototype for PeerTo-Peer Network of Manufacturing Nodes.

This study aims to analyze the price behavior of bitcoin and apply machine learning algorithm for its prediction. Understanding the nature of Bitcoin price series is a multi-scale problem, and it can be best examined by analyzing its compositional characteristics. This study uses complete empirical ensemble mode decomposition (CEEMD) to analyze the nature of Bitcoin price series. Daily Bitcoin prices from 2012 to 2018 are used to perform CEEMD to identify the short term, medium term, and long-term trend in the Bitcoin price series. The study uses support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm to find whether it can predict Bitcoin prices and finds that SVM predicts five steps ahead Bitcoin prices for the short term, medium term, long term, and overall Bitcoin price level. © 2020","Bitcoin; Complete empirical ensemble mode with adaptive noise decomposition (CEEMDAN); Cryptocurrency; Empirical mode decomposition (EMD); Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD); Support vector machine",,"Ahmadi, M.A., Toward reliable model for prediction drilling fluid density at wellbore conditions: A LSSVM model (2016) Neurocomputing, 211, pp. 143-149; Ahmadi, M.H., Ahmadi, M.A., Sadatsakkak, S.A., Feidt, M., Connectionist intelligent model estimates output power and torque of stirling engine (2015) Renew.

However, these ground-truth datasets are frequently affected by significant class imbalance as generally they contain much more information regarding legal services (Exchange, Gambling), than regarding services that may be related to illicit activities (Mixer, Service). Class imbalance increases the complexity of applying machine learning techniques and reduces the quality of classification results, especially for underrepresented, but critical classes.In this paper, we propose to address this problem by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Bitcoin data augmentation as GANs recently have shown promising results in the domain of image classification. However, there is no 'one-fits-all' GAN solution that works for every scenario. In fact, setting GAN training parameters is non-trivial and heavily affects the quality of the generated synthetic data. We therefore evaluate how GAN parameters such as the optimization function, the size of the dataset and the chosen batch size affect GAN implementation for one underrepresented entity class (Mining Pool) and demonstrate how a 'good' GAN configuration can be obtained that achieves high similarity between synthetically generated and real Bitcoin address data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study presenting GANs as a valid tool for generating synthetic address data for data augmentation in Bitcoin entity classification. © 2020 IEEE.","address behaviour; Bitcoin classifier; class imbalance; data augmentation; Generative Adversarial Network","740558

Nevertheless, the users of machine learning usually find that these sophisticated techniques could incur a high level of tensions caused by the selection of the appropriate size of the training data set among other factors. In this paper, we provide a systematic way of resolving such tensions by examining practical examples of predicting popularity and sentiment of posts on Twitter and Facebook, blogs on Mashable, news on Google and Yahoo, the US house survey, and Bitcoin prices. Interesting results show that for the case of big data, using around 20% of the full sample often leads to a better prediction accuracy than opting for the full sample. Our conclusion is found to be consistent across a series of experiments. The managerial implication is that using more is not necessarily the best and users need to be cautious about such an important sensitivity as the simplistic approach may easily lead to inferior solutions with potentially detrimental consequences. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Big data; Data size; Machine learning; Prediction accuracy; Social media",,"Abdollahi, M., Khaleghi, T., Yang, K., An integrated feature learning approach using deep learning for travel time prediction (2020) Expert Syst.

Several types of illicit users hide behind the blanket of anonymity. Uncovering these entities is key for forensic investigations. Current methods utilize machine learning for identifying these illicit entities. However, the existing approaches only focus on a limited category of illicit users. The current paper proposes to address the issue by implementing an ensemble of decision trees for supervised learning. More parameters allow the ensemble model to learn discriminating features that can categorize multiple groups of illicit users from licit users. To evaluate the model, a dataset of 2059 real-life entities on Bitcoin was extracted from the Blockchain. Nine features were engineered to train the model for segregating 28 different licit-illicit categories of users. The proposed model provided a reliable tool for forensic study. Empirical evaluation of the proposed model vis-a-vis three existing benchmark models was performed to highlight its efficacy. Experiments showed that the specificity and sensitivity of the proposed model were comparable to other models. © 2020 ACM.","Bitcoin; Data Mining; Fraud detection; Supervised Learning",,"Sabry, F., Labda, W., Erbad, A., Al Jawaheri, H., Malluhi, Q., Anonymity and privacy in bitcoin escrow trades (2019) Proceedings of the 18th ACM Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society, pp. 211-220; Rahouti, M., Xiong, K., Ghani, N., Bitcoin concepts, threats, and machine-learning security solutions (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 67189-67205; Toyoda, K., Takis Mathiopoulos, P., Ohtsuki, T., A novel methodology for hyip operators' bitcoin addresses identification (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 74835-74848; Lee, C., Maharjan, S., Ko, K., Won-Ki Hong, J., Toward detecting illegal transactions on bitcoin using machine-learning methods (2020) Blockchain and Trustworthy Systems, pp. 520-533. , Zibin Zheng, Hong-Ning Dai, Mingdong Tang, and Xiangping Chen, editors Singapore, Springer Singapore; Foley, S., Karlsen, J.R., Putnin, T.J., Sex, drugs, and bit-coin: How much illegal activity is financed through cryptocurrencies?

Despite the great evolution of the time series theory, forecasters are still in the hunt for better models to make more accurate decisions. The huge advances in neural networks over the last years has led to the emergence of a new generation of effective models replacing classic econometric models. It is in this direction that we propose, in this paper, a new multiscaled Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), with the aim of forecasting multivariate time series. This new model, called Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)-based Neural ARDL, is inspired from the well-known Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model being our proposal founded upon the concepts of nonlinearity, EMD-multiresolution and neural networks. These features give the model the ability to effectively capture many nonlinear patterns like the ones often present in econophysical time series, such as nonlinear trends, seasonal effects, long-range dependency, etc. The proposed algorithm can be summarized into the following four basic tasks: (i) EMD breaking-down multivariate time series into different resolution levels, (ii) feeding EMD components from the same levels into a number of feedforward neural ARDL models, (iii) from one level to the next, extrapolating the component corresponding to the response variable (scalar output) a number of steps ahead, and finally, (iv) recombining level-by-level forecasts into a single output. An optimal learning scheme is rigorously designed for efficiently training the new proposed architecture. The approach is finally tested and compared to a number of powerful benchmark models, where experiments are conducted on real-world data. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","autoregressive distributed lag; bitcoin-oil nexus; empirical mode decomposition; Feedforward neural networks","","Pesaran, M.

Specifically, the authors explore how distinct these patterns are and their potential value for intelligence exploitation in support of countering ransomware attacks. Design/methodology/approach: The authors created an analytic framework – the Ransomware–Bitcoin Intelligence–Forensic Continuum framework – to search for transaction patterns in the blockchain records from actual ransomware attacks. Data of a number of different ransomware Bitcoin addresses was extracted to populate the framework, via the WalletExplorer.com programming interface. This data was then assembled in a representation of the target network for pattern analysis on the input (cash-in) and output (cash-out) side of the ransomware seed addresses. Different graph algorithms were applied to these networks. The results were compared to a “control” network derived from a Bitcoin charity. Findings: The findings show discernible patterns in the network relating to the input and output side of the ransomware graphs. However, these patterns are not easily distinguishable from those associated with the charity Bitcoin address on the input side. Nonetheless, the collection profile over time is more volatile than with the charity Bitcoin address. On the other hand, ransomware output patterns differ from those associated charity addresses, as the attacker cash-out tactics are quite different from the way charities mobilise their donations. We further argue that an application of graph machine learning provides a basis for future analysis and data refinement possibilities. Research limitations/implications: Limitations are evident in the sample size of data taken on ransomware campaigns and the “control” subject. Further analysis of additional ransomware campaigns and “control” subjects over time would help refine and validate the preliminary observations in this paper. Future research will also benefit from the application of more powerful computing resources and analytics platforms that scale with the amount of data being collected. Originality/value: This research contributes to the maturity of the field by analysing ransomware-Bitcoin behaviour using the Ransomware–Bitcoin Intelligence–Forensic Continuum. By combining several different techniques to discerning patterns of ransomware activity on the Bitcoin network, it provides insight into whether a ransomware attack is occurring and could be used to trigger alerts to seek additional evidence of attack, or could corroborate other information in the system. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; Graph analysis; Illicit money flows; Ransomware",,"Ahn, G.J., Doupe, A., Zhao, Z., Liao, K., Ransomware and cryptocurrency: partners in crime (2016) Cybercrime through an Interdisciplinary Lens, pp. 119-140. , Routledge; Bellei, C., (2019) The elliptic data set: opening up machine learning on the blockchain, , https://medium.com/elliptic/the-elliptic-data-set-opening-up-machine-learning-on-the-blockchain-e0a343d99a14, (accessed: 11 November 2019; Bistarelli, S., Parroccini, M., Santini, F., Visualizing bitcoin flows of ransomware: WannaCry one week later (2018) ITASEC, ser.

In this paper, some forecasting models based on classical like ARIMA and machine learning approaches including Kriging, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Bayesian method, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) are proposed and analyzed for modelling and forecasting the Bitcoin price. While some of the proposed models are univariate, the other models are multivariate and as a result, the maximum, minimum and the opening daily price of Bitcoin are also used in these models. The proposed models are applied on the Bitcoin price from December 18, 2019 to March 1, 2020 and their performances are compared in terms of the performance measures of RMSE and MAPE by Diebold- Mariano statistical test. Based on RMSE and MAPE measures, the results show that SVM provides the best performance among all the models. In addition, ARIMA and Bayesian approaches outperform other univariate models where they provide smaller values for RMSE and MAPE. © 2020 Materials and Energy Research Center.

Forecasting the Bitcoin price as accurate as possible is essential, but due to its high volatility this task is challenging. Many researchers try, through the years, to develop efficient models for predicting the Bitcoin price using several different data-driven approaches. The objective of this paper is to develop a novel decomposition-ensemble learning model that combines Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Stacking-ensemble learning (STACK) with machine learning algorithms to forecast the Bitcoin price multi-step ahead. The algorithms are k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regression with Linear kernel, Feed-forward Artificial Neural Network with single-layer perceptron, Generalized Linear Model, and Cubist. Correlation matrix (CORR), principal component analysis (PCA), and Box-Cox transformation (BOXCOX) were used as data preprocessing techniques. Estimating the performance of the proposed models (namely VMD-STACK-CORR, VMD-STACK-PCA, and VMD-STACK-BOXCOX) using relative root mean square error, symmetric mean absolute percentage error, and absolute percentage error measures, defined that for one-day-ahead forecast VMD-STAK-BOXCOX model presented the better performance, and for two and three-days-ahead forecast VMD-STACK-CORR model was chosen, compared to VMD, STACK, and machine learning algorithms models' performance. Diebold-Mariano statistical test was conducted to evaluate a reduction in forecasting errors. Therefore, the proposed models (VMD-STACK-CORR, VMD-STACK-PCA, and VMD-STACK-BOXCOX) indeed forecast accurately Bitcoin price and outperformed the compared models (VMD, STACK, and machine learning models). © 2020 IEEE.","Bitcoin price; forecasting; stacking-ensemble learning; time series; variational mode decomposition","307958/2019-1-PQ, 307966/2019-4-PQ, 405101/2016-3, 404659/2016-0

Investors have taken note of several advantages Bitcoin provides over the traditional banking system. One such trait is that Bitcoin allows for decentralized banking, meaning that Bitcoin cannot be regulated by powerful banks. There is also a market cap of 21 million Bitcoins that can be in circulation, therefore a surplus of Bitcoins cannot be “printed” which would result in inflation. Bitcoin resolves the issue with transaction security by using a block chain, or a ledger, which records the history of every transaction ever made into one long hexadecimal “chain” of anonymous transactions, which keeps transaction history transparent, but also confidential. Bitcoin as a result has become a very bullish investing opportunity, and due to the huge volatility of the Bitcoin market price, this paper attempts to aid in investment decision making by providing Bitcoin market price prediction. Our team explored several Machine Learning algorithms by using Supervised Learning to train a prediction model and provide informative analysis of future market prices. We start with Linear Regression models, and train on several important features, then We proceed with the implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells. All code is written in Python using Google’s Tensor Flow software library. We show that the price of Bitcoin can be predicted with Machine Learning with high degree of accuracy. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Due to its anonymity and globalization, bitcoin has achieved great success and attracted the attention of various illegal traders. In recent years, the number of illegal transactions of bitcoin has been increasing. Although bitcoin can support a certain amount of privacy, the bitcoin users and entity information can be linked by tracking the on-chain information of bitcoin users and combining the public off-chain information. Through bitcoin users de-anonymization, we can obtain some valuable intelligence information, which plays an important role in combating bitcoin-related crimes. In this paper, we build a visual analysis system for bitcoin transactions based on a graph database and use real-world multi-dimensional data sources to analyze the entity information of bitcoin transactions on the chain to achieve the effect of de-anonymization. Besides, we adopt a supervised learning method in our system to predict the legitimacy of unknown bitcoin transactions. Experiments and analyses show that our system can achieve good correlation analysis and de-anonymization. Finally, we put forward the future research direction of the bitcoin de-anonymization field. © 2020 IEEE.","Bitcoin; De-anonymization; Graph; Machine learning; Multidimensional data",,"Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, , http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf; Foley, S., Karlsen, J., Putnins, T., Sex, drugs, and bitcoin: How much illegal activity is financed through cryptocurrencies?

Since the volatility forecasts help trading decisions of traders who want a profit, the volatility forecasting is an important task in the market. For the improvement of the forecasting accuracy of Bitcoin's volatility, we develop the hybrid forecasting models combining the GARCH family models with the machine learning (ML) approach. Specifically, we adopt Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Higher Order Neural Network (HONN) for the ML approach and construct the hybrid models using the outputs of the GARCH models and several relevant variables as input variables. We carry out many experiments based on the proposed models and compare the forecasting accuracy of the models. In addition, we provide the Model Confidence Set (MCS) test to find statistically the best model. The results show that the hybrid models based on HONN provide more accurate forecasts than the other models. © 2020 by the authors.","Artificial neural network; Bitcoin; Higher order neural network; Hybrid models; Volatility forecasting","NRF-2017R1E1A1A03070886","Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System;, , ReadLiberty.

The point of this is to determine the precision of cryptocurrency values utilizing various AI algorithms and predict their estimated prices. The dataset that we will be using contains consolidated financial information for the top 10 cryptocurrencies sorted by Market Cap which also have various attributes for each type of cryptocurrency such as open, close, high, low, value and date. Therefore, we are going to use Linear Regression, SGD Regression, Support Vector Regression, and LSTM algorithms to predict the various cryptocurrencies prices. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Although this trait permits concealing in the plain sight, the public ledger of Bitcoin blockchain provides more power for investigators and allows collective intelligence for anti-money laundering and forensic analysis. This fascinating paradox arises in the strength of Bitcoin technology. Machine learning techniques have attained promising results in forensic analysis, in order to spot suspicious behaviour in Bitcoin blockchain. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the performance of classical supervised learning methods using a recently published data set derived from Bitcoin blockchain, to predict licit and illicit transactions in the network. Besides, an ensemble learning method is utilised using a combination of the given supervised learning models, which outperforms the given classical methods. This experiment is performed using a newly published data set derived from Bitcoin blockchain. Our main contribution points out that using ensemble learning approach outperforms the performance of the classical learning models used in the original paper, using Elliptic data set, a time series of Bitcoin transaction graph with node transactions and directed payments flow edges. Using the same data set, we show that we are able to predict licit/illicit transactions with an accuracy of 98.13% and F1 score equals to 83.36% using the proposed method. We discuss the variety of supervised learning methods, and their capabilities of assisting forensic analysis, and propose future work directions. © 2020 ACM.","Anomaly Detection; Anti-Money Laundering; Ensemble Method; Financial Forensics; Supervised Learning","","Bistarelli, S., Santini, F., Go with the-bitcoin-flow, with visual analytics. in (2017) Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security, pp. 1-6; Breiman, L., Random forests 2001 (2001) Machine Learning, 45 (1), pp. 5-32; Nitesh, V., Chawla, S., Data mining for imbalanced datasets: An overview. in (2009) Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Handbook, pp. 875-886. , Springer; Bryan Crawford, J., (2019) 2019.

Due to the complexity of Bitcoin transaction graph, the prediction of illicit transactions has become a challenging problem to unveil illicit services over the network. Graph Convolutional Network, a graph neural network based spectral approach, has recently emerged and gained much attention regarding graph-structured data. Previous research has highlighted the degraded performance of the latter approach to predict illicit transactions using, a Bitcoin transaction graph, so-called Elliptic data derived from Bitcoin blockchain. Motivated by the previous work, we seek to explore graph convolutions in a novel way. For this purpose, we present a novel approach that is modelled using the existing Graph Convolutional Network intertwined with linear layers. Concisely, we concatenate node embeddings obtained from graph convolutional layers with a single hidden layer derived from the linear transformation of the node feature matrix and followed by Multi-layer Perceptron. Our approach is evaluated using Elliptic data, wherein efficient accuracy is yielded. The proposed approach outperforms the original work of same data set. © 2020 ACM.","Anomaly Detection; Anti-Money Laundering; Bitcoin Blockchain; Graph Convolutional Network; Supervised Learning","","Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-To-peer Electronic Cash System, 2008; Taha Ali, S., Bitcoin: Perils of an Unregulated Global P2P Currency (Transcript of Discussion) (2015) Cambridge International Workshop on Security Protocols, pp. 294-306. , Springer; Karlstrom, H., 2014.

We introduce a methodology that combines topological data analysis with a machine learning technique – k-means clustering – in order to characterize the emerging chaotic regime in a complex system approaching a critical transition. We first test our methodology on the complex system dynamics of a Lorenz-type attractor. Then we apply it to the four major cryptocurrencies.

The observation data used in this study were collected during January, 5 2017 to October, 1 2019 (in total 1,000 daily observation data). The statistical method used in this study were ARIMA (Autoregressive Moving Average) and Exponential Smoothing. The artificial intelligent model were used in this study were fuzzy time series and ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System). The partitions data set were of 75%-25% of training and testing, respectively. The cryptocurrency investigated was bitcoin (BTC) which is the top three of most widely traded cryptocurrency. The forecasting results show that the classical method has the smallest value of RMSE and MSE which is exponential smoothing with 9749.81 for MSE and 98.74 for RMSE. However, the performance of forecasting method cannot be guaranteed from either classical or modern forecasting method.

This can be done by injecting a malicious javascript code into the website. The malicious javascript code injected utilizes system's resources in order to compute hashes.Most of the classic cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, monero, webchain are built on proof-of-work(pow) algorithm called CryptoNight, which is CPU-bound. They make use of memorybound functions for constructing computational puzzles [1], in order to maximize profit. This total process requires a lot of disc read and write operations. Hence, we have monitored the cache activity to detect whether cryptojacking exists or not.

The purpose of our study is to comparatively evaluate a plethora of Artificial Intelligence systems in forecasting high frequency Bitcoin price series. We employ three different sets of models, i.e., statistical machine learning approaches including support vector regressions (SVR) and Gaussian Poisson regressions (GRP), algorithmic models such as regression trees (RT) and the k-nearest neighbours (kNN) and finally artificial neural network topologies such as feedforward (FFNN), Bayesian regularization (BRNN) and radial basis function networks (RBFNN). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an extensive empirical investigation of the comparative predictability of various machine learning models is implemented in high-frequency trading of Bitcoin. The entropy analysis of training and testing samples reveals long memory traits, high levels of stochasticity, and topological complexity. The presence of inherent nonlinear dynamics of Bitcoin time series fully rationalizes the use of advanced machines learning techniques. The optimal parameter values for SVR, GRP and kNN are found via Bayesian optimization. Based on diverse performance metrics, our results show that the BRNN renders an outstanding accuracy in forecasting, while its convergence is unhindered and remarkably fast. The overall superiority of artificial neural networks is due to parallel processing features that efficiently emulate human decision-making in the presence of underlying nonlinear input-output relationships in noisy signal environments. © 2020","90.01 Social Phenomena; Bitcoin; Forecasting; Intraday trading; Machine learning",,"https://coinmarketcap.com/, Available online: (accessed on 04 December 2019); Stosic, D., Stosic, D., Ludermir, T.B., Stosic, T., Exploring disorder and complexity in the cryptocurrency space (2019) Physica A, 525, pp. 548-556; Song, J.Y., Chang, W., Song, J.W., Cluster analysis on the structure of the cryptocurrency market via Bitcoin-Ethereum filtering (2019) Physica A, 527. , Article 121339; Lahmiri, S., Bekiros, S., Salvi, A., memory, L.-R., distributional variation and randomness of bitcoin volatility (2018) Chaos Solitons Fractals, 107, pp. 43-48; Pele, D.T., Mazurencu-Marinescu-Pele, M., Using high-frequency entropy to forecast bitcoin's daily value at risk (2019) Entropy, (21); Cheng, Q., Liu, X., Zhu, X., Cryptocurrency momentum effect: DFA and MF-DFA analysis (2019) Physica A, 526. , Article 120847; Stavroyiannis, S., Babalos, V., Bekiros, S., Lahmiri, S., Uddin, G.S., The high frequency multifractal properties of Bitcoin (2019) Physica A, 520, pp. 62-71; Lahmiri, S., Bekiros, S., Big data analytics using multi-fractal wavelet leaders in high-frequency Bitcoin markets (2019) Chaos Solitons Fractals; Zhang, X., Yang, L., Zhu, Y., Analysis of multifractal characterization of Bitcoin market based on multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (2019) Physica A, 523, pp. 973-983; Borri, N., Conditional tail-risk in cryptocurrency markets (2019) J Empir Finance, 50, pp. 1-19; Peng, Y., Melo Albuquerque, P.H., Camboim de Sá, J.M., Padula, A.J.A., Montenegro, M.R., The best of two worlds: forecasting high frequency volatility for cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies with support vector regression (2018) Expert Syst Appl, 97, pp. 177-192; Lahmiri, S., Bekiros, S., Cryptocurrency forecasting with deep learning chaotic neural networks (2019) Chaos Solitons Fractals, 118, pp. 35-40; McNally, S., Roche, J., Caton, S., Predicting the price of Bitcoin using machine learning (2018) IEEE 26th euromicro international conference on parallel, distributed and network-based processing; Sutiksno, D.U., Ahmar, A.S., Kurniasih, N., Susanto, E., Leiwakabessy, A., Forecasting historical data of Bitcoin using ARIMA and α-Sutte indicator (2018) IOP Conf Ser J Phys, 1028; Catania, L., Grassi, S., Francesco Ravazzolo, Forecasting cryptocurrencies under model and parameter instability (2019) Int J Forecast, 35, pp. 485-501; Akcora, C.G., Dey, A.K., Gel, Y.R., Kantarcioglu, M., Forecasting Bitcoin price with graph chainlets (2018) Advances in knowledge discovery and data mining. lecture notes in computer science, 10939. , D Phung V Tseng G Webb B Ho M Ganji L Rashidi Springer, Cham; Atsalakis, G.S., Atsalaki, I.G., Pasiouras, F., Zopounidis, C., Bitcoin price forecasting with neuro-fuzzy techniques (2019) Eur J Oper Res, 276, pp. 770-780; Xiaolei, S., Mingxi, L., Zeqian, S., A novel cryptocurrency price trend forecasting model based on LightGBM (2018) Finance Res Lett; Vapnik, V., Golowich, S., Smola, A., Support vector machine for function approximation, regression estimation, and signal processing (1996) Adv Neural Inf Process Syst, 9, pp. 281-287; Rasmussen, C.E., Williams, C.K., Gaussian processes for machine learning (2006), Massachusetts Institute of Technology: MIT-Press; Morgan, J.N., Sonquist, J.A., Problems in the analysis of survey data, and a proposal (1963) J Am Stat Assoc, 58, pp. 415-434; Cover, T.M., Hart, P.E., Nearest neighbor pattern classification (1967) IEEE Trans Inf Theory, 13, pp. 21-27; Haykin, S.O., Neural networks and learning machines (2008), 3rd ed Pearson; Burden, F., Winkler, D., Bayesian regularization of neural networks (2008) Methods Mol Boil, 458, p. 25e; Cybenko, G., Approximations by superpositions of a sigmoidal function (1989) Math Control, Signals Syst, 2, pp. 303-314; Gelbart, M., Snoek, J., Adams, R.P., (2014), https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5607, Bayesian optimization with unknown constraints; Peng, C.-K., Buldyrev, S.V., Havlin, S., Simons H.E.

By gathering information from different reference papers and applying in real time,I found the advantages and disadvantages of bitcoin price prediction. Each and every paper has its own set of methodologies of bitcoin price prediction. Many papers has accurate price but some other don’t, but the time complexity is higher in those predictions, so to reduce the time complexity here in this paper we use an algorithm linked to artificial intelligence named LASSO(least absolute shrinkage selection operator. The other papers used different algorithms like SVM(support vector machine),coinmarkupcap, Quandl, GLM, CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks)and RNN(Recurrent neural networks) etc.. which do not have a great time management, but in LASSO finding of the results from a larger database is quick and fast..so for this purpose we draw a comparison between other algorithms and the LASSO algorithm, this survey paper helps the upcoming researchers to make an impact in the their papers. The process happens in the paper is first moment of the research, we aim to understand and find daily trends in the Bitcoin market while gaining insight into optimal f eatures surrounding Bitcoin price. Our data set consists of various features relating to the Bitcoin price and payment network over the course of every years, recorded daily. By preprocessing the dataset, we apply the some data mining techniques to reduce the noise of data.

Bitcoin is currently one of the largest cryptocurrencies in terms of capital market share. Therefore, this study proposes that sentiment analysis can be used as a computational tool to predict the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for different time intervals. A key characteristic of the cryptocurrency market is that the fluctuation of currency prices depends on people's perceptions and opinions, not institutional money regulation. Therefore, analysing the relationship between social media and web search is crucial for cryptocurrency price prediction. This study uses Twitter and Google Trends to forecast the short-term prices of the primary cryptocurrencies, as these social media platforms are used to influence purchasing decisions. The study adopts and interpolates a unique multimodel approach to analyse the impact of social media on cryptocurrency prices. Our results prove that people's psychological and behavioural attitudes have a significant impact on the highly speculative cryptocurrency prices. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","cryptocurrencies; machine learning; sentiment analysis; social media; speculative models",,"Abraham, J., Higdon, D., Nelson, J., Ibarra, J., Cryptocurrency price prediction using tweet volumes and sentiment analysis (2018) SMU Data Science Review, 1 (3), p. 1; Alessandretti, L., ElBahrawy, A., Aiello, L.M., Baronchelli, A., (2018) Machine learning the cryptocurrency market, , SSRN 3183792; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X.-J., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2, pp. 1-8. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocs.2010.12.007; Bottou, L., Large-scale machine learning with stochastic gradient descent (2010) Proceedings of COMPSTAT'2010, pp. 177-186. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-7908-2604-3_16, Y.

While many variations of attention have been developed over recent years, all share a common component in the application of a softmax function to normalize the attention weights, in order to transform them into valid mixing coefficients. In this paper, we aim to improve the modeling flexibility of a generic attention module by innovatively replacing this softmax operation with a learnable softmax, in which the normalizing functions are also adapted from the data. Specifically, our generalized softmax builds upon recent work in learning activation functions for deep networks, in particular the kernel activation function and its extensions. We describe the application of the proposed technique for the challenging case of time series forecasting with the dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (DA-RNN), an innovative model for predicting time series that employs two different attention modules for handling exogenous factors and long-term dependencies. A series of real-world benchmarks are used to show that simply plugging-in our generalized attention model can improve results on all datasets, even when keeping the number of trainable parameters in the model constant. To further evaluate the algorithm, we collect a novel dataset for predicting the Bitcoin closing exchange rate, a problem of high practical significance lately. Finally, to foster research in the topic, we also release both the dataset and our model as an open source extensible library. Over a baseline DA-RNN, our proposed model delivers an improvement of MAR ranging from 6% to 15% using our newly-released dataset. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Activation function; Attention; Softmax; Time series forecasting","","Agostinelli, F., Hoffman, M., Sadowski, P., Baldi, P., (2014), Learning activation functions to improve deep neural networks, arXiv:; Alessandretti, L., ElBahrawy, A., Aiello, L.M., Baronchelli, A., Anticipating cryptocurrency prices using machine learning (2018) Complexity, 2018; Amjad, U., Jilani, T.A., Tariq, H., Hussain, A., A quantum based evolutionary algorithm for stock index and bitcoin price forecasting (2018) Int.

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, reached all-time highs many times over the year leading to speculations to explain the trend in its growth. In this article, we study Bitcoin and Ethereum and explore features in their network that explain their price hikes. We gather data and analyze user and network activity that highly impact the price of these cryptocurrencies. We monitor the change in the activities over time and relate them to economic theories. We identify key network features that help us to determine the demand and supply dynamics in a cryptocurrency. Finally, we use machine learning methods to construct models that predict Bitcoin price. Based on our experimental results using two large datasets for validation, we confirm that our approach provides an accuracy of up to 99% for Bitcoin and Ethereum price prediction in both instances. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Ethereum; Prediction","2017R1A4A1015675, NRF-2016K1A1A2912757","Krafft, P.M., Penna, N.D., Pentland, A.S., An experimental study of cryptocurrencymarket dynamics (2018) Proc.

Because of its highly volatile nature, there is a need for good predictions on which to base investment decisions. Although existing studies have leveraged machine learning for more accurate Bitcoin price prediction, few have focused on the feasibility of applying different modeling techniques to samples with different data structures and dimensional features. To predict Bitcoin price at different frequencies using machine learning techniques, we first classify Bitcoin price by daily price and high-frequency price. A set of high-dimension features including property and network, trading and market, attention and gold spot price are used for Bitcoin daily price prediction, while the basic trading features acquired from a cryptocurrency exchange are used for 5-minute interval price prediction. Statistical methods including Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis for Bitcoin daily price prediction with high-dimensional features achieve an accuracy of 66%, outperforming more complicated machine learning algorithms. Compared with benchmark results for daily price prediction, we achieve a better performance, with the highest accuracies of the statistical methods and machine learning algorithms of 66% and 65.3%, respectively. Machine learning models including Random Forest, XGBoost, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine and Long Short-term Memory for Bitcoin 5-minute interval price prediction are superior to statistical methods, with accuracy reaching 67.2%.

The right action is related to massive stock market measurements. Therefore, defining the right action requires specific knowledge from investors. The economy scientists, following their research, have suggested several strategies and indicating factors that serve to find the best option for trading in a stock market. However, several investors' capital decreased when they tried to trade the basis of the recommendation of these strategies. That means the stock market needs more satisfactory research, which can give more guarantee of success for investors. To address this challenge, we tried to apply one of the machine learning algorithms, which is called deep reinforcement learning (DRL) on the stock market. As a result, we developed an application that observes historical price movements and takes action on real-time prices. We tested our proposal algorithm with three-Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum (ETH)-crypto coins' historical data. The experiment on Bitcoin via DRL application shows that the investor got 14.4% net profits within one month. Similarly, tests on Litecoin and Ethereum also finished with 74% and 41% profit, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.","Day trading; Deep reinforcement learning; Double cross strategy; Machine learning; Moving average; Position trading; Scalping; Swing trading; Trading","2018R1D1A1B07043417

The Bitcoin network also employs public key cryptography to prevent the disclosure of information related to participating users. Although the public key cryptography ensures the privacy and hides the true identity of users in the Bitcoin network, it has recently been abused for illegal activities that have tarnished the charm of this novel technology. Detecting the illegal transactions associated with illicit activities in Bitcoin is therefore imperative. This paper proposes a machine-learning based approach that classifies Bitcoin transactions as illegal or legal. The detected illegal transactions can be excluded from the subsequent block, promoting user acceptance and adoption of the Bitcoin technology. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Bitcoin; Bitcoin transaction analysis; Classification; Illegal transaction detection; Transaction feature extraction","IITP-2017-2017-0-01633","Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System; Swan, M., (2015) Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy, , O’Reilly Media Inc., Sebastopol; Harvey, C.R., (2014) Bitcoin Myths and Facts; https://www.chainalysis.com/; Pal, M., Random forest classifier for remote sensing classification (2005) Int.

One of the main problems with decentralized cryptocurrencies is price volatility, which indicates the need for studying the underlying price model. Moreover, Bitcoin prices exhibit non-stationary behavior, where the statistical distribution of data changes over time. This paper demonstrates high-performance machine learning-based classification and regression models for predicting Bitcoin price movements and prices in short and medium terms. In previous works, machine learning-based classification has been studied for an only one-day time frame, while this work goes beyond that by using machine learning-based models for one, seven, thirty and ninety days. The developed models are feasible and have high performance, with the classification models scoring up to 65% accuracy for next-day forecast and scoring from 62 to 64% accuracy for seventh–ninetieth-day forecast. For daily price forecast, the error percentage is as low as 1.44%, while it varies from 2.88 to 4.10% for horizons of seven to ninety days.

By exploiting this pseudonymity, various illegal activities are conducted around the world. To detect and deter illegal transactions, this paper proposes a method of identifying the characteristics of bitcoin addresses related to illegal transactions. We extracted 80 features from bitcoin transactions. Using machine-learning techniques, we successfully categorized addresses involved with illegal activities with a 84% accuracy. We also examined the address features most affecting classification performance and compared two machine-learning models. By applying the majority voting to the classification results of bitcoin addresses associated with a particular transaction, it will be possible to determine which category the transaction belongs to. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Address feature extraction; Bitcoin; Bitcoin address classification; Bitcoin transaction analysis; Illegal transaction detection",,"Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System; Swan, M., (2015) Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy, , O’Reilly Media Inc., Newton; Harvey, C.R., (2014) Bitcoin Myths and Facts.

In doing so, we test various machine learning models and find that, while all models outperform a random classifier, recurrent neural networks and gradient boosting classifiers are especially well-suited for the examined prediction tasks. We use a comprehensive feature set, including technical, blockchain-based, sentiment-/interest-based, and asset-based features. Our results show that technical features remain most relevant for most methods, followed by selected blockchain-based and interest-based features. Additionally, we find that predictability increases for longer prediction horizons. Although a quantile-based long-short trading strategy generates monthly returns of up to 31% before transaction costs, it leads to negative returns after taking transaction costs into account due to the particularly short holding periods. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bitcoin; Financial market prediction; Gradient boosting; Machine learning; Neural networks; Random forests",,"Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System, , Working paper; Feng, G., Giglio, S., Xiu, D., Taming the factor zoo: A test of new factors (2020) J.

It was said to have potential in changing the way of trading in future. However, Bitcoin price prediction is a hard task and difficult for investors to make a decision. This is caused by nonlinearity property of the Bitcoin price. Hence, a better forecasting method is essential to minimize the risk from inaccuracy decision. The aim of this paper is to first compare three different neural networks which are Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Input (NARX) Neural Network and Nonlinear Autoregressive (NAR) Neural Network by obtaining the predicted result for each model. The best model is identified by evaluating the performance measurement of each model. After obtaining the best model, it is used to undergo 30 days ahead forecast. The result showed that the performance of NARX out-performed FNN and NAR. It is proven NARX is the suitable neural network to forecast Bitcoin price. The resulting model provides new insights into Bitcoin forecasting using NARX which directly benefits the investors and economists in lowering the risk of making the inaccurate decision when it comes to investing in Bitcoin. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

It made Bitcoin a very profitable market for investment but Bitcoin saw many ups and down as well. Today's Bitcoin price is 3913 USD but that doesn't mean that the prices always keep falling. The price of Bitcoin vary over time and is governed by various factors, like the market it is being traded in, scarcity, supply and demand. What has made Bitcoin valuable is that it can be used as a currency, we can pay a part or a fraction of Bitcoin to a person in exchange for something and the part is easily verifiable by blockchain. The small number of Bitcoin, roughly 16 million Bitcoins for the entire world has made it scare and above that its high utility makes it more prestigious.Trading of Bitcoin has proved to be very profitable to many people but the risk in trading is huge as the market of Bitcoin is very volatile. To decrease the risks, this project has been carried out to predict the price of Bitcoin using Recurrent Neural Network(RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Linear Regression(LR) to predict the price of Bitcoin. Evaluation of these algorithms is carried out to determine which among the two is better for the prediction of Bitcoin prices. The dataset used contains minute by minute prices of Bitcoin of over 5 years and contains almost 30,00,000 entries. Since, the dataset used is a big data, evaluating the performance of algorithms over a large dataset will give accurate results. © 2020 IEEE.","Bitcoin; cryptocurrency; Linear regression; Long short term memory; Recurrent neural network",,"Gupta, S., Wang, L.P., Stock forecasting with feedforward neural networks and gradual data sub-sampling (2010) Australian Journal of Intelligent Information Processing Systems, 11, pp. 14-17; Zheng, T.X., Fataliyev, K., Wang, L.P., Wavelet neural networks for stock trading and prediction (2013) Invited Oral Presentation, Spie Defense, Security, and Sensing, 29. , Bal-timore, USA; Khashei, M., Bijari, M., An artificial neural network (p,d,q) model for timeseries forecasting (2010) Expert Systems with Applications, 37, pp. 479-489. , January; Shah, D., Zhang, K., Bayesian regression and bitcoin (2015) 52nd Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton, pp. 409-415; Daniela, M., Butoi, A., Data mining on romanian stock market using neural networks for price prediction (2013) Informatica Economica, 3, p. 17; Greaves, A., Au, B., (2015) Using the Bitcoin Transaction Graph to Predict the Price of Bitcoin; Yoon, Y., Swales, G., Predicting stock price performance: A neural network approach (1991) System Sciences 1991.

Anonymity makes Bitcoin widely used in online payment but it is a disadvantage for regulatory purposes. We aim to de-anonymize Bitcoin to assist regulation. Many previous studies have used heuristic clustering or machine learning to analyze historical transactions and identify user behaviors. However, the accuracy of user identification is not ideal. Heuristic clustering only uses the topological structure of the transaction graph and ignores many transaction information, and supervised machine learning methods are limited by the size of labeled datasets. To identify user behaviors, we propose a community detection model based on attribute propagation, combining the topological structure of the transaction graph and additional transaction information. We first parse the transaction data of public ledger and construct a bipartite graph to describe correlations between addresses and transactions. We also extract address attributes from historical transactions to construct an attributed graph with the previous bipartite graph. Then, we design an adaptive weighted attribute propagation algorithm named AWAP running on the attributed graph to classify bitcoin addresses, and further identify user behaviors. Extensive experiments highlight that the proposed detection model based on AWAP achieves 5% higher accuracy on average compared to state-of-the-art address classification methods in Bitcoin. AWAP also achieves 25% higher F-score on average compared to previous community detection algorithms on two datasets. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Attribute propagation; Bitcoin anonymity; Community detection",,"Bartoletti, M., Pes, B., Serusi, S., Data mining for detecting bitcoin Ponzi schemes (2018) 2018 Crypto Valley Conference on Blockchain Technology (CVCBT), pp. 75-84. , IEEE; Blondel, V.D., Guillaume, J.L., Lambiotte, R., Lefebvre, E., Fast unfolding of communities in large networks (2008) J.

To implement the proposed method, we applied machine learning to the transactions data collected from the Bitcoin network and divided our implementation into the following three objects: Data Collector; Data Preprocessor; and Analyzer. We used the random forest classifier algorithm because the problem of predicting the likelihood of a transaction to be included in the next block is a binary classification problem. We evaluated the performance of our model by comparing transactions in the mempool against transaction published in the next two blocks mined at the time of our experiments. For both blocks, our model has a prediction accuracy of more than 80% and a minimal false negative error. The analysis of transaction inclusion in the next block is fundamental as it could drive the price of Bitcoin or signify the properties of a given transaction such as illegal or legal. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Machine learning; Transaction prediction; Transaction selection policy","2018-000539","Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System; Swan, M., (2015) Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy, , O’Reilly Media, Inc., Sebastopol; Crosby, M., Blockchain technology: Beyond bitcoin (2016) Appl.

Several types of illicit users hide behind the blanket of anonymity. Uncovering these entities is key for forensic investigations. Current methods utilize machine learning for identifying these illicit entities. However, the existing approaches only focus on a limited category of illicit users. The current paper proposes to address the issue by implementing an ensemble of decision trees for supervised learning. More parameters allow the ensemble model to learn discriminating features that can categorize multiple groups of illicit users from licit users. To evaluate the model, a dataset of 1216 real-life entities on Bitcoin was extracted from the Blockchain. Nine Features were engineered to train the model for segregating 16 different licit-illicit categories of users. The proposed model provided a reliable tool for forensic study. Empirical evaluation of the proposed model vis-a-vis three existing benchmark models was performed to highlight its efficacy. Experiments showed that the specificity and sensitivity of the proposed model were comparable to other models. Due to higher parameters of the ensemble tree model, the classification accuracy was 0.91, with 95% CI - 0.8727, 0.9477. This was better than SVM and Logistic Regression, the two popular models in the literature and comparable to the Random Forest and XGBOOST model. CPU and RAM utilization were also monitored to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed work for real-world deployment. RAM utilization for the proposed model was higher by 30-45% compared to the other three models. Hence, the proposed model is resource-intensive as it has higher parameters than the other three models. Higher parameters also result in higher accuracy of predictions. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bitcoin; Exploratory data analysis; Fraud detection",,"Aiolli, F., Conti, M., Gangwal, A., Polato, M., (2019) Mind your wallet’s privacy: Identifying bitcoin wallet apps and user’s actions through network traffic analysis, , https://doi.org/10.1145/3297280.3297430; Akcora, C.G., Li, Y., Gel, Y.R., Kantarcioglu, M., (2019) Bitcoinheist: Topological Data Analysis for Ransomware Detection on the Bitcoin Blockchain.; Alqassem, I., Rahwan, I., Svetinovic, D., The anti-social system properties: Bitcoin network data analysis (2018) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern Syst; Bartoletti, M., Pes, B., Serusi, S., Data mining for detecting bitcoin ponzi schemes (2018) 2018 Crypto Valley Conference on Blockchain Technology (CVCBT), pp. 75-84; Bistarelli, S., Mercanti, I., Santini, F., A suite of tools for the forensic analysis of bitcoin transactions: Preliminary report (2018) European Conference on Parallel Processing, pp. 329-341. , Springer; Bogner, A., Seeing is understanding: Anomaly detection in blockchains with visualized features (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers, pp. 5-8; Bohannon, J., (2016) The Bitcoin Busts; Böhme, R., Christin, N., Edelman, B., Moore, T., Bitcoin: economics, technology, and governance (2015) J Econ Perspect, 29 (2), pp. 213-238; Bonneau, J., Narayanan, A., Miller, A., Clark, J., Kroll, J.A., Felten, E.W., Mixcoin: Anonymity for bitcoin with accountable mixes (2014) International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security.

It is a turning point in the way currency is seen. Now the currency, rather than being physical is becoming more and more digital. Due to high variance of solo mining, the number of users joining top most famous bitcoin mining pools is increasing due to the fact that users together under a bitcoin pool will have a higher chance of generating next block in the bitcoins blockchain by reducing the variance and earning the mining reward. In this research paper we are doing a survey on the technology lying underneath bitcoin's network and the various machine learning predictive algorithms. We collected the dataset on bitcoin blockchain from 28 April 2013 to 31 July 2017 which is publicly available on https://coinmarketcap.com and applied the ARIMA model for price prediction of bitcoin.

One of the key characteristics of Bitcoin is anonymity, which makes the Bitcoin market unregulated and a large number of criminal and illicit activities are associated with bitcoin transactions. Therefore, it’s necessary to identify the illicit addresses in the Bitcoin network for safeguarding financial systems and protecting user’s assets. To identify the illicit addresses in the Bitcoin network, first, we collect a large dataset of illicit addresses. The illicit addresses come mainly from some specific websites, public forums, and research papers. Second, we make a careful design of the features of illicit addresses. The features include basic features that refer to the related papers and the novel proposed features (topological features and temporal features). Third, we apply various machine learning algorithms (RF, SVM, XGB, ANN) to evaluate our features, which indicates that the proposed features are discriminating and robust. Besides, the paper discusses the class imbalance problem and achieves a better enhancement when using the cost-sensitive approach. Moreover, the paper proposes a model that incorporates LSTM into auto-encoder to generate temporal features. Results show that the generated features are helpful for the illicit addresses identification. Finally, the dataset and code are released in Github. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Auto-encoder; Bitcoin; Illicit addresses; Machine learning; Temporal features; Topological features","2018B010109001

For this goal, we applied several the most powerful methods including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forests (RF) and Stochastic Gradient Boosting Machine (SGBM). As dataset were selected the daily close prices of two stock index: SP 500 and NASDAQ, two the most capitalized cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and exchange rate of EUR-USD. As features we used only the past price information. To check the efficiency of these models we made out-of-sample forecast for selected time series by using one step ahead technique. The accuracy rates of the forecasted prices by using ML models were calculated. The results verify the applicability of the ML approach for the forecasting of financial time series. The best out of sample accuracy of short-term prediction daily close prices for selected time series obtained by SGBM and MLP in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) was within 0.46-3.71 %. Our results are comparable with accuracy obtained by Deep learning approaches.

In today’s digital threat environment, the rate of ransomware infection has trended upwards to dominate the cyber threat landscape and become one of the emerging threats facing organizations and individuals. In addition to the traditional ransomware, new types have become predominant and they are called fileless ransomware. They use legitimate administration programs and turn them into a tool for fileless infection which is undetectable with traditional security solutions that are based essentially on signature-based detection. In addition to this fileless characteristic, this kind of threat can also be combined with USB-based attacks, also known as HID (Human interface device) attack. In this article, we will present a new attack vector that combines, HID attack, Networking, and fileless ransomware attack on Windows Operating System (OS) machine and then we will present a proposed solution that involves the logistic regression as a Machine learning technique to mitigate against the HID Fileless Ransomware attack. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Fileless-ransomware; HID attack; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Ransomware; Signature-based detection",,"Carbon, B., (2019) Global Threat Report: The Year of The Next-Gen Cyberattack, , January; Al-Rimy, B.A.S., Maarof, M.A., Zainudeen, S., Shaid, M., Ransomware threat success factors, taxonomy, and countermeasures.

We consider that influencer tweets may affect crypto-asset prices. In this research, we propose a method to predict whether bitcoin price will increase or decrease using influencer tweets. For this, we collect influencer tweets to extract features using natural language processing techniques; these features are used as input for machine learning methods, which also use bitcoin price data.

However, its applications are now more widespread, and in many areas, this technology has become the foundation of the distributed ledger. The blockchain protocol assumes that all the participants of the system are both contributors and safeguards of this ledger, since the lack of a trusted third party requires other security precautions in order to maintain the consistency of transactions. In this work, we investigate whether for the participants of a blockchain-based system that does not require revealing the character explicitly, it can be discovered by other means. In order to verify this, we built and publicly released a dataset of nearly 9,000 addresses of nodes in the most popular cryptocurrency - Bitcoin, and then labelled them. These labels represent the character the nodes have in the network, e.g. miners or exchanges. We then developed a set of features that quantify the behaviour of nodes in the network and used supervised machine learning algorithms to find out whether the character of nodes can be revealed based on these features. Our results demonstrate, due to the F-score reaching over 95% in the best-performing algorithms, that it is hard to hide the role the node has in a blockchain-based network. These results indicate that to build trustworthy blockchain-based systems that fully comply with original blockchain assumptions, specific countermeasures are needed in order to preserve the desired level of anonymity. © 2013 IEEE.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; cryptocurrencies; machine learning; node2vec; supervised learning",,"Alsalami, N., Zhang, B., SoK: A systematic study of anonymity in cryptocurrencies (2019) Proc.

We then extend the HAR-RV model to include a metric of US–China trade tensions. This is our primary forecasting variable of interest, and it is based on Google Trends. We also control for jumps, realized skewness, and realized kurtosis. For our empirical analysis, we use a machine-learning technique that is known as random forests.

Several algorithms are considered: the genetic algorithm, the grid search, and particle swarm optimization. Theoretical guarantees of prediction accuracy are tested with sine curves. From a numerical testing perspective, we are interested in showing the superiority of one approach to another based on theoretical prediction and time series applications in finance (S&P 500), commodities (WTI oil price), or cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin). The superiority of hybrid models to soft- and hard-computed models is further assessed through a ‘horse race’ and trading performance, as well as through fine-tuning of the algorithms. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Genetic algorithms; Grid Search; Least squares support vector machine; Particle swarm optimization",,"Alvarez-Ramirez, J., Ibarra-Valdeza, C., Bernabel, A., Power-law periodicity in the 2003–2004 crude oil price dynamics (2005) Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 349, pp. 625-640; Bao, Y., Hu, Z., Xiong, T., A PSO and pattern search based memetic algorithm for SVMs parameters optimization (2013) Neurocomputing, 117, pp. 98-106; Beasley, D., Bull, D.R., Martin, R.R., (1993) An Overview of Genetic Algorithms: Part 1, Fundamentals.

To properly incentivize data owners to contribute their efforts, Shapley Value (SV) is often adopted to fairly and quantitatively assess their contributions. However, the calculation of SV is time-consuming and computationally costly. In this chapter, we propose FedCoin, a blockchain-based peer-to-peer payment system for FL to enable a feasible SV based profit distribution. In FedCoin, blockchain consensus entities calculate SVs and a new block is created based on the proof of Shapley (PoSap) protocol. It is in contrast to the popular BitCoin network where consensus entities “mine” new blocks by solving meaningless puzzles. Based on the computed SVs, we propose a scheme for dividing the incentive payoffs among FL participants with non-repudiation and tamper-resistance properties. Experimental results based on real-world data show that FedCoin can promote high-quality data from FL participants through accurately computing SVs with an upper bound on the computational resources required for reaching block consensus. It opens opportunities for non-data owners to play a role in FL. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; Federated learning; Shapley value","61702084, 61702090

The cost associated with the lucrative cryptomining has driven general masses to unethically mine cryptocurrencies using 'plundered' resources in the public organizations (e.g., universities) as well as in the corporate sector that follows Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) culture. Such exploitation of the resources causes financial detriment to the affected organizations, which often discover the abuse when the damage has already been done. In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages magnetic side-channel to detect covert cryptomining. Our proposed approach works even when the examiner does not have login-access or root-privileges on the suspect device. It merely requires the physical proximity of the examiner and a magnetic sensor, which is often available on smartphones. The fundamental idea of our approach is to profile the magnetic field emission of a processor for the set of available mining algorithms. We built a complete implementation of our system using advanced machine learning techniques. In our experiments, we included all the cryptocurrencies supported by the top-10 mining pools, which collectively comprise the largest share (84% during Q3 2018) of the cryptomining market. Moreover, we tested our methodology primarily on two different laptops. By using the data recorded from the magnetometer of an ordinary smartphone, our classifier achieved an average precision of over 88% and an average F1 score of 87%. Apart from our primary goal - which is to identify covert cryptomining - we also performed four additional experiments to further evaluate our approach. We found that due to its underlying design, our system is future-ready and can readily adapt even to zero-day cryptocurrencies. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Altcoin; Bitcoin; cryptocurrency; detection; machine learning; mining","H2020-SU-SEC-2018-832735

This emerging technology has the potential to enhance various authentication and verification processes in image sharing and data security. It has the potential to promote patient-centered healthcare by giving greater control to patients over their own data. Blockchain can also be utilized for administrative tasks, such as credentialing, claims adjudication, and billing management. It can also be utilized to enhance software supporting research and clinical trials. Blockchain complements artificial intelligence (AI) and these can work synergistically to create better solutions. Although many challenges exist for increased adoption of blockchain within radiology and healthcare in general, it can play a major role in our practice and consequently, it is important for medical imaging professionals to become familiar with the technology. © 2019","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Ethereum; Machine learning; Radiology",,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain, Blockchain - Wikipedia [Internet].

It is pioneered largely by bitcoin, a blockchain technology, and a financial application of decentralization, which has impacted a lot on how financial transactions happen in a secure manner. The advantage of using this technology is that there is no central authority to rely on. Thus, a decentralized storage of medical records would allow forgeries on the records to be reduced. We propose a solution to avoid forgery in healthcare sector using blockchain. The blockchain network in the proposed system will time-stamp and store healthcare management data and its associated files in the network storage. The network is decentralized; thus, the data is inherently secure. Yet this approach may create a storage exploitation and may lead to breakdown of the system. However, a machine learning-based classification model is used to decide upon which records that get into the blockchain to reduce the required storage. Hence, a system to securely store healthcare data using blockchain technology can be implemented or created. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Blockchain; Classification; Decentralization; Healthcare; Machine learning; Medical records",,"Owenson, G., Dennis, R., Aziz, B., A temporal blockchain: A formal analysis (2016) International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems, pp. 430-437; Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System, , https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf; (2017) Bitcoin Developer Guide, , https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#block-chain; Pattanayak, P., Verma, S., Crosby, M., Nachiappankalyanaraman, V., (2016) Blockchain Technology: Beyond Bitcoin, , http://scet.berkeley.edu/wpcontent/uploads/AIR-2016-Blockchain.pdf; Tschorsch, F., Scheuermann, B., Bitcoin and beyond: A technical survey on decentralized digital currencies (2015) IEEE Commun.

There are over 1300 different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. While the scope of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies continues to increase, identification of unethical and fraudulent behaviour still remains an open issue. The absence of regulation of the cryptocurrencies ecosystem and the lack of transparency of the transactions may lead to an increased number of fraudulent cases. In this research, we have analyzed the possibility to identify fraudulent behaviour using different classification techniques. Based on Etherium transactional data, we constructed a transaction network which was analyzed using a graph traversal algorithm. Data clustering was performed using three machine learning algorithms: k-means clustering, Support Vector Machine and random forest classifier. The performance of the classifiers was evaluated using a few accuracy metrics that can be calculated from confusion matrix. Research results revealed that the best performance was achieved using a random forest classification model. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Cryptocurrencies price volatility prediction is a challenging task owing to the high stochasticity of the markets. Econometric, machine learning and deep learning models are investigated to tackle the stochastic financial prices fluctuation and to improve the prediction accuracy. Although the introduction of exogenous factors such as macro-financial indicators and blockchain information helps the model prediction more accurately, the noise and effects from markets and political conditions are difficult to interpret and modelling. Inspired by the evidence of strong correlations among cryptocurrencies examined in previous studies, we originally propose a Weighted Memory Channels Regression (WMCR) model to predict the daily close price of cryptocurrencies. The proposed model receives time series of several heavyweight cryptocurrencies price and learns the interdependencies of them by recalibrating the weights of each sequence wisely. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) components are exploited to establish memory and extract spatial and temporal features. Moreover, regularization methods including kernel regularizers and bias regularizers and Dropout method are exploited to improve the generalization ability of the proposed model. A battery of experiments are conducted in this paper. The results present that the WMCR model achieves the state-of-art performance and outperforms other baseline models. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Blockchain; Convolutional neural network; Cryptocurencies price prediction; Deep learning; Long short-term memory; Weighted memory channels","0025/2019/AKP

It allows users to interact together by sharing and posting contents. The concept of spreading content between users raises an important question: Who are the users responsible for this content? In other words, the detection of content spreaders becomes one of the most important analytic issues. The common belief is that the best content spreaders are the best connected users (the most central users within network). Specifically, k-shell decomposition methodology defines the most efficient content spreaders as those located within the core of the network. In this paper, influence ranking model (IRM) is presented to rank SN users based on their contribution in spreading a specific content. The proposed model is inspired by the pruning process of the powerful k-shell decomposition methodology. IRM has been evaluated in realistic experiments using the famous datasets of Advogato trust network and Bitcoin Alpha trust weighted signed network. The proposed model was assessed in terms of distinction of nodes ranking and dissemination capability. Results have shown that IRM has promising results in SN users ranking. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Influential users; K-shell; Microblogging; Social Networks",,"Chai, W., (2013) ACQR: A Novel Framework to Identify and Predict Influential Users in Micro-Blogging, p.

In algorithmic trading, an innovative approach to integrate machine learning can provide data-driven solutions to help people invest with minimal risk and maximum return. This study explores various machine learning techniques to model the nonlinear relationship between bitcoin price and social sentiment data and predict price values with some lead time. Also, the cryptocurrency market is very volatile and lack strict governing bodies and regulators across regions making it more complex and challenging to predict the prices. Through the analysis, it is found that the sentiment data model is superior in capturing the nonlinear relationship compared to the conventional methods of technical indicators and decision trees, while the neural network models are robust and offer better accuracy in predicting the bitcoin price. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Typically, Bitcoin activity is monitored by decreasing anonymity of its entities using machine learning-based techniques, which consider the whole blockchain. This entails two issues: first, it increases the complexity of the analysis requiring higher efforts and, second, it may hide network micro-dynamics important for detecting short-term changes in entity behavioral patterns. The aim of this paper is to address both issues by performing a 'temporal dissection' of the Bitcoin blockchain, i.e., dividing it into smaller temporal batches to achieve entity classification. The idea is that a machine learning model trained on a certain time-interval (batch) should achieve good classification performance when tested on another batch if entity behavioral patterns are similar. We apply cascading machine learning principles'a type of ensemble learning applying stacking techniques'introducing a 'k-fold cross-testing' concept across batches of varying size. Results show that blockchain batch size used for entity classification could be reduced for certain classes (Exchange, Gambling, and eWallet) as classification rates did not vary significantly with batch size; suggesting that behavioral patterns did not change significantly over time. Mixer and Market class detection, however, can be negatively affected. A deeper analysis of Mining Pool behavior showed that models trained on recent data perform better than models trained on older data, suggesting that 'typical' Mining Pool behavior may be represented better by recent data. This work provides a first step towards uncovering entity behavioral changes via temporal dissection of blockchain data. © 2019 by the authors.","Behavioral patterns; Bitcoin analysis; Ensemble learning; Entities detection; Machine learning; Time-series analysis","740558

Many attempts have been made to adjust and predict the fee volatility, but even well-formed transactions sometimes experience delays and evictions unless an enormous fee is paid. In this paper, we present a novel machine-learning model, solving a binary classification problem, that can predict transaction fee volatility in the Bitcoin network so that users can optimize their fees expenses and the approval time for their transactions. The model's output will give a confidence score whether a new incoming transaction will be included in the next mined block. The model is trained on data from a longitudinal study of the Bitcoin blockchain, containing more than 10 million transactions. New features that we generate include information on how many bytes were already occupied by other transactions in the mempool, assuming they are ordered by fee density in each mining pool. The collected dataset allows to generate a model for transaction inclusion pattern prediction in the Bitcoin network, hence telling whether a transaction is well formed or not, according to the previous transactions analyzed. With this, we obtain a prediction score for up to 86%. © 2019 IEEE.","Bitcoin; blockchain; longitudinal study; machine learning; neural networks; performance; transaction latency","275516, 263248","Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-To-peer Electronic Cash System., , https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf; Rizun, P.R., (2015) A Transaction Fee Market Exists Without A Block Size Limit, , Block Size Limit Debate Working Paper; Decker, C., Wattenhofer, R., Information propagation in the bitcoin network (2013) IEEE P2P 2013 Proceedings, pp. 1-10. , Sept; Tedeschi, E., Johansen, H.D., Johansen, D., Trading network performance for cash in the bitcoin blockchain (2018) Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science, CLOSER 2018, pp. 643-650. , Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, March 19-21, 2018; Möser, M., Böhme, R., Trends, tips, tolls: A longitudinal study of bitcoin transaction fees (2015) Financial Cryptography and Data Security: FC 2015., (8976), pp. 19-33. , in LNCS, (Berlin, Heidelberg), Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Qureshi, H., (2019) Blockchain Fees Are Broken.

Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are not backed by any government agencies resulting in prices being strongly influenced by public opinion. Understanding the relationship between cryptocurrency prices and the public sentiment can lead to improved predictions of price movement. In this paper, we give an exploratory analysis of a network of 24 Reddit communities related to Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies to analyze Bitcoin and Ethereum price movements. We engineer a set of 112 time series features from submissions and comments made on the selected subreddits, run Granger causality tests on engineered time series against cryptocurrency price movements, and use these time series to forecast the cryptocurrency price movements using classification models. Results from these models support the Granger causality test results showing that with only lagged price values and lagged values from a single Reddit data derived feature, the direction of Bitcoin and Ethereum price movements can be predicted with 74.2% and 73.1% accuracy respectively. © 2019 IEEE.","Cryptocurrency; Gradient Boosting Machines; Granger causality; PageRank; Sentiment analysis; Time series analysis",,"Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System; Crosby, M., Pattanayak, P., Verma, S., Kalyanaraman, V., Blockchain technology: Beyond bitcoin (2016) Applied Innovation, 2 (6-10), p. 71; Elbahrawy, A., Alessandretti, L., Kandler, A., Pastor-Satorras, R., Baronchelli, A., Evolutionary dynamics of the cryptocurrency market (2017) Royal Society Open Science, 4 (11), p. 170623; Phillips, R.C., Gorse, D., Cryptocurrency price drivers: Wavelet coherence analysis revisited (2018) PloS One, 13 (4), p. e0195200; Newman, M.E., Power laws, pareto distributions and zipf's law (2005) Contemporary Physics, 46 (5), pp. 323-351; Nasir, M.A., Huynh, T.L.D., Nguyen, S.P., Duong, D., Forecasting cryptocurrency returns and volume using search engines (2019) Financial Innovation, 5 (1), p. 2; Steinert, L., Herff, C., Predicting altcoin returns using social media (2018) PloS One, 13 (12), p. e0208119; Matta, M., Lunesu, I., Marchesi, M., Bitcoin spread prediction using social and web search media (2015) UMAP Workshops, pp. 1-10; Linton, M., Teo, E.G.S., Bommes, E., Chen, C., Härdle, W.K., Dynamic topic modelling for cryptocurrency community forums (2017) Applied Quantitative Finance, pp. 355-372. , Springer; Kim, Y.B., Kim, J.G., Kim, W., Im, J.H., Kim, T.H., Kang, S.J., Kim, C.H., Predicting fluctuations in cryptocurrency transactions based on user comments and replies (2016) PloS One, 11 (8), p. e0161197; Li, T.R., Chamrajnagar, A.S., Fong, X.R., Rizik, N.R., Fu, F., (2018) Sentiment-based Prediction of Alternative Cryptocurrency Price Fluctuations Using Gradient Boosting Tree Model; Park, A., Conway, M., Chen, A.T., Examining thematic similarity, difference, and membership in three online mental health communities from reddit: A text mining and visualization approach (2018) Computers in Human Behavior, 78, pp. 98-112; Choi, D., Han, J., Chung, T., Ahn, Y.-Y., Chun, B.-G., Kwon, T.T., Characterizing conversation patterns in reddit: From the perspectives of content properties and user participation behaviors (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 Acm on Conference on Online Social Networks.

However, there has been a lack of solutions that can support real-time price prediction to cope with high currency volatility, handle massive heterogeneous data volumes, including social media sentiments, while supporting fault tolerance and persistence in real time, and provide real-time adaptation of learning algorithms to cope with new price and sentiment data. In this paper we introduce KryptoOracle, a novel real-time and adaptive cryptocurrency price prediction platform based on Twitter sentiments. The integrative and modular platform is based on (i) a Spark-based architecture which handles the large volume of incoming data in a persistent and fault tolerant way; (ii) an approach that supports sentiment analysis which can respond to large amounts of natural language processing queries in real time; and (iii) a predictive method grounded on online learning in which a model adapts its weights to cope with new prices and sentiments. Besides providing an architectural design, the paper also describes the KryptoOracle platform implementation and experimental evaluation. Overall, the proposed platform can help accelerate decision-making, uncover new opportunities and provide more timely insights based on the available and ever-larger financial data volume and variety. © 2019 IEEE.","cryptocurrency; machine learning; price prediction; real time; sentiment analysis; social media; software platform; Spark",,"Cryptocurrency-what Is A Cryptocurrency ?, , https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp; Cryptolization-cryptocurrency Market Cap Analysis, , https://cryptolization.com; Lamon, C., Nielsen, E., Redondo, E., Cryptocurrency price prediction using news and social media sentiment (2017) SMU Data Sci.

In 2009, it was introduced by a person (or a group of people) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto before putting on the market as open source software. Bitcoin is a new payment system and investment tool for the purchase, storage and use of money as digitally. However, when people want to invest in bitcoin, the biggest factor they have to consider is how the price will change in the future. Recent developments in the field of machine learning have shown that some algorithms can provide appropriate solutions to predict future prices of crypto currencies. In this study, a detailed literature review is made about the studies using machine learning methods to estimate the future price of bitcoin. Basic and current information about bitcoin was included in this study. In addition, the theory of machine learning methods used is explained.

Traditionally, there are several techniques such as univariate Autoregressive (AR), univariate Moving Average (MA), Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), and more notably Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with their many variations that can effectively forecast. However, with the recent advancement in the computational capacity of computers and more importantly developing more advanced machine learning algorithms and approaches such as deep learning, new algorithms have been developed to forecast time series data.

Correspondingly, many researchers have investigated various factors that affect the Bitcoin price and the patterns behind its fluctuations, in particular, using various machine learning methods. In this paper, we study and compare various state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as a deep neural network (DNN), a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, a convolutional neural network, a deep residual network, and their combinations for Bitcoin price prediction. Experimental results showed that although LSTM-based prediction models slightly outperformed the other prediction models for Bitcoin price prediction (regression), DNN-based models performed the best for price ups and downs prediction (classification). In addition, a simple profitability analysis showed that classification models were more effective than regression models for algorithmic trading. Overall, the performances of the proposed deep learning-based prediction models were comparable. © 2019 by the authors.

These changes in different time slices can be defined as four different evolutionary events: survive, split, fusion and disappearance. In this paper, the network representation learning method is used to map the graph embedding of the network into the low-dimensional vector space to study the prediction of dynamic community evolution events. In the features, based on the features of community internal attributes, the change of temporal attributes, and the previous community evolution events, the potential structure characteristics of the four evolutionary events are introduced and obtained by using random walk and Softmax. In the model, the strategy of deep random forest is proposed. Feature fusion and feature training are carried out by using the attention mechanism and Monte Carlo feature sampling strategy, which overcomes the shortcomings of the existing algorithms that only acquire local structural features. Finally, by comparing SVM, XGBOOST, RIDGE model training in the DBLP, FACEBOOK and Bitcoin datasets, it is confirmed that the embedding feature of community structure and the attention deep random forest model improvement have greatly improved the accuracy of final prediction. © 2019, Chinese Institute of Electronics.

This study shows Recurrent Neural Network Learning Model on the basis of LSTM, which analyzes the previous prices of a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin and predicts the next one. Methods/Statistical analysis: This model indicates the actual and predicted prices of Bitcoin for 81 days in the way that it has learned the former prices for 30 days and then anticipates the next day price. Regularized data set for Modeling is divided into test data set and training data set at the rate of 1:9. The latter set is once again separated into training data and verification ones. Machine Learning of this study needs to use Neural Network library, Keras framework. Findings: To fit the model is to look for the model’s weight by optimizing the process, while using the training data. In this paper, fit function’s batch size is 11 and epochs is 30. As learning gets processed more repetitively, the loss decreases more monotonously, and then it converges to more regular value. That is, it means there is no overfitting. Improvements/Applications: As the result of the experiment, the machine learning proposes not only that after analyzing the graphs of error rates and weight change rates, weight converges towards a particular one, but also that as learning goes over, the processing efficiency of its neural network gets better. © 2019 SERSC.","Bitcoin; Block Chain; LSTM; Prediction; Price; Recurrent Neural Network",,"Archana, C., Savita, K., Raj, K., Machine Learning Classification Techniques: A Comparative Study (2013) International Journal on Advanced Computer Theory and Engineering (IJACTE), 2 (4), pp. 21-25; Pavlyshenko, B.M., Machine-Learning Models for Sales Time Series Forecasting (2019) Data, 4 (1), p. 15. , ) Mar; Nakamoto, S., Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System, , https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf, Available from; https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/market-price?timespan=all, InternetAvailable from; Kim, J.S., A Survey of Cryptocurrencies based on Blockchain (2019) Journal of the Korea Society of Computer and Information, 24 (2), pp. 67-74. , Feb, http://dx.doi.org/; Cann, O., Artificial Intelligence & Robotics Top List of Technologies in Need of Better Governance, , https://www.weforum.org/press/(2016)/11/artificial-intelligence-robotics-top-list-of-technologies-in-need-of-better-governance/, [Internet].

Predicting the number of transactions contained in a Bitcoin block is important in a Bitcoin network. The aim of this paper is to propose a learning feature selection method for designing a machine learning model that predicts the number of transactions contained in the Bitcoin block by applying the machine learning algorithm. Selecting the appropriate feature to design a machine learning model is crucial things to the performance of the model. We apply correlation analysis to select the appropriate learning feature of the transaction count prediction model in the Bitcoin block and verify the validity of the proposed method through experiments. © 2019 IEICE.","Bitcoin; Coefficient Analysis; Cryptocurrency; Feature Selection; Machine Learning","NRF-2018R1D1A1B07045742

The ability to access a super computer is now available to any user with a credit card. Wide adoption has fueled the rise of many new industries and disruptive technologies. Building competitive, highly performing systematic algorithms is within reach for even small, bootstrapped organizations, but the availability of cheap computing power alone is insufficient to be highly successful. What matters is the amount of data an organization can access and analyze in a time sensitive fashion. We analyze the intersection of Big Data analytics and cloud computing with a focus on creating investment algorithmic strategies to trade different cryptocurrencies. It is now possible to access high quality, inexpensive time series data sets. However, the exponential increase in the size of data sets, as well as the number of data sets required makes analysis infeasible for even very powerful desktop computers. Specifically, this paper will delve into the application of Machine Learning, its unique demands, and its application to modeling cryptocurrencies through the use of Big Data and cloud computing leveraging AWS and PaperSpace. We will explore the unique approach of using a circuit of ML algorithms to improve predictive power and its dependence on cloud computing structure. © 2019 IEEE.","Amazon Web Services; Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; Iaas; Machine learning; PaperSpace",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus

Its unregulated nature and inherent anonymity of users have led to a dramatic increase in its use for illicit activities. This calls for the development of novel methods capable of characterizing different entities in the Bitcoin network. In this paper, a method to attack Bitcoin anonymity is presented, leveraging a novel cascading machine learning approach that requires only a few features directly extracted from Bitcoin blockchain data. Cascading, used to enrich entities information with data from previous classifications, led to considerably improved multi-class classification performance with excellent values of Precision close to 1.0 for each considered class. Final models were implemented and compared using different machine learning models and showed significantly higher accuracy compared to their baseline implementation. Our approach can contribute to the development of effective tools for Bitcoin entity characterization, which may assist in uncovering illegal activities. © 2019 IEEE.","Bitcoin analysis; Bitcoin anonymity; Blockchain; Cascading classifiers; Entities classification; Graph model","740558

Our C2P2 algorithm is the first algorithm to consider the fact that the price of a cryptocurrency c might depend not only on historical prices, sentiments, global stock indices, but also on the prices and predicted prices of other cryptocurrencies. C2P2 therefore does not predict cryptocurrency prices one coin at a time - rather it uses similarity metrics in conjunction with collective classification to compare multiple cryptocurrency features to jointly predict the cryptocurrency prices for all 21 coins considered. We show that our C2P2 algorithm beats out a recent competing 2017 paper by margins varying from 5.1-83% and another Bitcoin-specific prediction paper from 2018 by 16%. In both cases, C2P2 is the winner on all cryptocurrencies considered. Moreover, we experimentally show that the use of similarity metrics within our C2P2 algorithm leads to a direct improvement for 20 out of 21 cryptocurrencies ranging from 0.4% to 17.8%. Without the similarity component, C2P2 still beats competitors on 20 out of 21 cryptocurrencies considered.

One fundamental problem is how to stable the block interval. To address this problem, our method is: 1. predict the computing power (i.e., hashrate) of a blockchain system by the cryptocurrency price; 2. stable the interval according to the predicted power. This paper focuses on the prediction of the global computing power. In our prediction, we adopt a LSTM-based regression algorithm to handle the hysteresis of computing power changes in response to the price changes.

These systems usually exploit supervised models trained on historical data in order to automatically generate buy/sell signals on the financial markets. Although in this context a deep exploration of the Stock, Forex, and Future exchange markets has already been made, a more limited effort has been devoted to the application of machine learning techniques to the emerging cryptocurrency exchange market. This paper explores the potential of the most established classification and time series forecasting models in cryptocurrency trading by backtesting model performance over a eight year period. The results show that, due to the heterogeneity and volatility of the underlying financial instruments, prediction models based on series forecasting perform better than classification techniques. Furthermore, trading multiple cryptocurrencies at the same time significantly increases the overall returns compared to baseline strategies exclusively based on Bitcoin trading. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Classification; Cryptocurrencies; Machine learning; Quantitative trading",,"Michael Azoff, E., (1994) Neural Network Time Series Forecasting of Financial Markets, , 1st ed.).

However, the temporal dynamics of cryptocurrencies is highly complex, and predictions are still challenging. In this study, we establish two prevailing machine learning models, fully-connected Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM), to predictively model the price of several popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Litecoin (LTC), and Monero (XMR). We evaluate model performance and conduct sensitivity analysis to further understand our model behaviors. We find that although LSTM seems more appropriate for time sequence prediction task, ANN, in general, outrivals LSTM in our experiments. Using price information from other different cryptocurrencies for joint training and prediction could largely facilitate the prediction of BTC. Finally, the model predictive error is highly sensitive to the time scale of interest. © 2019 ACM.","ANN; Cryptocurrency price prediction; LSTM; Matching learning models",,"Rauchs, M., (2016) Cryptocurrencies Meeting Business Ecosystems: The Case of Bitcoin, , Available at SSRN 3095875; Liu, Y., Tsyvinski, A., Risks and returns of cryptocurrency [R] (2018) National Bureau of Economic Research; Shah, D., Zhang, K., Bayesian regression and Bitcoin (2014) 2014 52nd Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton).

Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, and they form an emerging market that is different from stocks. At present, there is already much work around the stock price prediction using news articles, but there are few papers on the cryptocurrency market. In this paper, we aim to research the effects of news articles on bitcoin prices. We extract features from news articles with both commonly used text feature extraction algorithms (e.g., N-Gram and TF-IDF) and SentiGraph, which is a novel text representation method we propose. SentiGraph takes advantages of sentiment analysis and transforms a news article into a graph. Compared with previous feature extraction methods, our experiment results show that this new approach is superior on the prediction accuracy, which also demonstrates the impacts of news articles on the bitcoin price. © 2019 IEEE.","Bitcoin Price Trends; Machine Learning; Text Mining","2018YFB0803405

The low barrier of entry and high data availability of the cryptocurrency market makes it an excellent subject of study, from which it is possible to derive insights into the behavior of markets through the application of sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques for the challenging task of stock market prediction. While there have been some previous studies, most of them have focused exclusively on the behavior of Bitcoin. In this paper, we propose the usage of common machine learning tools and available social media data for predicting the price movement of the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin cryptocurrency market movements. We compare the utilization of neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) while using elements from Twitter and market data as input features. The results show that it is possible to predict cryptocurrency markets using machine learning and sentiment analysis, where Twitter data by itself could be used to predict certain cryptocurrencies and that NN outperform the other models. © 2019 by the authors.","Cryptocurrencies; Machine learning; Price movement; Sentiment analysis",,"Ferreira, M., Rodrigues, S., Reis, C.I., Maximiano, M., Blockchain: A Tale of Two Applications (2018) Appl.

Features used are technical indicators not limited to trend, momentum, volume, volatility indicators and sentiment indicators. For Cross validation, Purged Walk forward cross validation has been used.

While many people are making investments in Cryptocurrency, the dynamical features, uncertainty, the predictability of Cryptocurrency are still mostly unknown, which dramatically risk the investments. It is a matter to try to understand the factors that infiuence the value formation. In this study, we use advanced artificial intelligence frameworks of fully connected Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network to analyse the price dynamics of Bitcoin, Etherum, and Ripple. We find that ANN tends to rely more on long-term history while LSTM tends to rely more on short-term dynamics, which indicate the efficiency of LSTM to utilise useful information hidden in historical memory is stronger than ANN. However, given enough historical information ANN can achieve a similar accuracy, compared with LSTM. This study provides a unique demonstration that Cryptocurrency market price is predictable. However, the explanation of the predictability could vary depending on the nature of the involved machine-learning model. © 2019 IEEE.","ANN; Cryptocurrency price prediction; LSTM; Neural network",,"Greaves, A., Au, B., Using the bitcoin transaction graph to predict the price of bitcoin (2015) No Data; Hayes, A.S., Cryptocurrency value formation: An empirical study leading to a cost of production model for valuing bitcoin (2017) Telematics and Informatics, 34 (7), pp. 1308-1321; Shah, D., Zhang, K., Bayesian regression and Bitcoin (2014) Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton), 2014 52nd Annual Allerton Conference on, pp. 409-414. , September.

We introduce LEAP, a trainable, general framework for predicting the presence and properties of edges on the basis of the local structure, topology, and labels of the graph. The LEAP framework is based on the exploration and machine-learning aggregation of the paths connecting nodes in a graph. We provide several methods for performing the aggregation phase by training path aggregators, and we demonstrate the flexibility and generality of the framework by applying it to the prediction of links and user ratings in social networks. We validate the LEAP framework on two problems: link prediction, and user rating prediction. On eight large datasets, among which the arXiv collaboration network, the Yeast protein-protein interaction, and the US airlines routes network, we show that the link prediction performance of LEAP is at least as good as the current state of the art methods, such as SEAL and WLNM. Next, we consider the problem of predicting user ratings on other users: this problem is known as the edge-weight prediction problem in weighted signed networks (WSN). On Bitcoin networks, and Wikipedia RfA, we show that LEAP performs consistently better than the Fairness & Goodness based regression models, varying the amount of training edges between 10 to 90%. These examples demonstrate that LEAP, in spite of its generality, can match or best the performance of approaches that have been especially crafted to solve very specific edge prediction problems. © 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 License.","Edge Learning; Neural Networks; Path Aggregation",,"Abadi, M., (2015) TensorFlow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Systems, , https://www.tensorflow.org/Softwareavailablefromtensorflow.org; Adamic, E., Adar, L.A., (2003) Friends and Neighbors on the Web, 3, pp. 211-230. , July 2003; Bahdanau, D., Cho, K., Bengio, Y., Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate (2014) CoRR, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473, abs/1409.0473 2014; Batagelj, V., Mrvar, A., (2006) Pajek Datasets, , http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data; Bonacich, P., Some unique properties of eigenvector centrality (2007) Social Networks, 29, pp. 555-564. , 2007; Brin, S., Page, L., Reprint of: The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual web search engine (1998) Computer Networks, 30, pp. 107-117. , 1998; Chollet, F., (2015) Keras, , https://keras.io; Grover, A., Leskovec, J., Node2vec: Scalable feature learning for networks (2016) Proceedings of the 22Nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'16), pp. 855-864. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2939672.2939754, ACM, New York, NY, USA; Hamilton, W., Ying, Z., Leskovec, J., Inductive representation learning on large graphs (2017) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 30, pp. 1024-1034. , http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6703-inductive-representation-learning-on-large-graphs.pdf, I.

The transaction efficiency among nations and the privacy benefiting from address anonymity of the Bitcoin network have attracted many activities such as payments, investments, gambling, and even money laundering in the past decade. Unfortunately, some criminal behaviors which took advantage of this platform were not identified. This has discouraged many governments to support cryptocurrency. Thus, the capability to identify criminal addresses becomes an important issue in the cryptocurrency network. In this paper, we propose new features in addition to those commonly used in the literature to build a classification model for detecting abnormality of Bitcoin network addresses. These features include various high orders of moments of transaction time (represented by block height) which summarizes the transaction history in an efficient way. The extracted features are trained by supervised machine learning methods on a labeling category data set. The experimental evaluation shows that these features have improved the performance of Bitcoin address classification significantly. We evaluate the results under eight classifiers and achieve the highest Micro-Fl /Macro-F1 of 87% /86% with LightGBM. © 2019 IEEE.","bitcoin; blockchain; classification; moments; transaction history summarization",,"Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-To-peer Electronic Cash System;

This paper discusses the scheme and delivery of project based learning in computer science engineering as major project which adopts undergraduate creativities and emphasizes on real-world, open-ended projects. These projects foster a wide range of abilities, not only those related to content knowledge or technical skills, but also practical skills. The goal for this innovative undergrad project is to show how a trained machine model can predict the price of a cryptocurrency if we give the right amount of data and computational power. It displays a graph with the predicted values. The most popular technology is the kind of technological solution that could help mankind predict future events. With vast amount of data being generated and recorded on a daily basis, we have finally come close to an era where predictions can be accurate and be generated based on concrete factual data. Furthermore, with the rise of the crypto digital era more heads have turned towards the digital market for investments. This gives us the opportunity to create a model capable of predicting crypto currencies primarily Bitcoin. This can be accomplished by using a series of machine learning techniques and methodologies. © 2019 IEEE.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Deep learning; Machine learning; Project-based learning; SVM",,"Solomon, G., Project-Based learning: A Primer (2003) Technology Learning, 23. , Jan; Hedley, M., An undergraduate microcontroller systems laboratory (1998) IEEE Transactions in Education, 41 (4), pp. 345-353. , Nov; Markkanen, H., Donzellini, G., Ponta, D., NetPro: Methodologies and tools for project based learning in internet Proceedins of World Conference on Educational Multimedia, pp. 1230-1235; Ponta, D., Donzellini, G., Markkanen, H., NetPro: Network based project learning in internet (2002) Proceedings of European Symposium of Intelligent Technologies, pp. 703-708; Ambrose, S.A., Amon, C.H., Systematic design of a first-year mechanical engineering course at Carnegie-Mellon University (1997) Journal of Engineering Education, 86, pp. 173-182. , Apr; Vocabulary-Bitcoin, , https://bitcoin.org/en/vocabulary#btc; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal; Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System, , https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf; Harvey, C., (2014) Bitcoin Myths and Facts, , http://ssrn.com/abstract=2479670, Working paper, Duke University; Athey, S., Parashkevov, I., Sarukkai, V., Xia, J., (2016) Bitcoin Pricing, Adoption, and Usage: Theory and Evidence, , Working paper, Stanford University; Pagnotta, E., Buraschi, A., (2018) An Equilibrium Valuation of Bitcoin and Decentralized Network Assets, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=3142022; Raskin, M., Yermack, D., Digital currencies, decentralized ledgers, and the future of central banking (2016) Working Paper, National Bureau of Economic Research; Yermack, D., Corporate governance and blockchains (2017) Review of Finance, 21 (1), pp. 7-31; Huberman, G., Leshno, J.D., Moallemi, C.C., Monopoly without a monopolist: An economic analysis of the bitcoin payment system (2017) Columbia Business School Research Paper No. 17-92; Harvey, C., (2016) Cryptofinance, , http://ssrn.com/abstract=2438299, Working paper, Duke University; Brock, W., Lakonishok, J., LeBaron, B., Simple technical trading rules and the stochastic proper-ties of stock returns (1992) Journal of Finance, 47 (5), pp. 1731-1764; Bessembinder, H., Chan, K., Market efficiency and the returns to technical analysis (1998) Financial Management, 27 (2), pp. 5-17; LeBaron, B., Technical trading rule profitability and foreign exchange intervention (1999) Journal of International Economics, 49 (1), pp. 125-143; Sullivan, R., Timmermann, A., White, H., Data-snooping, technical trading rule performance, and the bootstrap (1999) Journal of Finance, 54 (5), pp. 1647-1691; Han, Y., Yang, K., Zhou, G., A new anomaly: The crosssectional profitability of technical analysis (2013) Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 48 (5), pp. 1433-1461; Shynkevich, A., Performance of technical analysis in growth and small cap segments of the us equity market (2012) Journal of Banking and Finance, 36 (1), pp. 193-208; Neely, C.J., Rapach, D.E., Tu, J., Zhou, G., Forecasting the equity risk premium: The role of technical indicators (2014) Management Science, 60 (7), pp. 1772-1791; Huang, J.-Z., Huang, Z.J., (2018) Testing Moving Average Trading Strategies on ETFs, , http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3138690; Kim, K.J., Financial time series forecasting using support vector machines (2003) Neurocomputing, 55, pp. 307-319; Hunag, W., Nakamori, Y., Wang, S.Y., Forecasting stock market movement direction with support vector machine (2005) Computers and Operations Research, 32, pp. 2513-2522; Patel, J., Shah, S., Thakkar, P., Kotecha, K., Predicting stock and stock price index movement using Trend Deterministic Data Preparation and machine learning technques (2015) Expert Systems with Applications, 42, pp. 259-268; Lee, M.C., Using support vector machine with a hybrid feature selection method to the stock trend prediction (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36 (8), pp. 10896-10904; Ince, H., Trafalis, T.B., Short term forecasting with support vector machines and applications to stoke price prediction (2008) Inernational Journal of General Systems, 37, pp. 677-687; htttp://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2014/Isaac%20Madan,%20Shaurya%20Saluja,%20Aojia%20Zhao,Automated%20Bitcoin%20Trading%20via%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms.pdf; http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2014/Phillip%20Pham,Steven%20Li,%20Anomaly%20Detection%20in%20Bitcoin%20Network%20Using%20Unsupervised%20Learning%20Methods.pdf",,"IEEE Computer Society","English",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus

A vast majority of lightweight clients utilizes SPV. However, with the increase in the popularity of SPV, many attacks have been launched against it such as Spoof, Sniff, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). As SPV requires high processing speed, flexibility, and stability, association rule learning can be effectively used for attack detection in SPV. In this paper, we implement a DDoS attack detection system using Association rule learning in SPV. Then, we used a KDD dataset to analyze the detecting accuracy and processing time in comparison with a machine learning approach. In addition, we also used NSL-KDD and GureKDD datasets to validate the effectiveness of our method. Our results show that Association rule learning algorithm is capable of detecting the DDoS attack in SPV. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Association Rules; Cyber Security; Data Mining; DDos Detection; SPV",,"https://bitcoin.org/en/developerguide#simplified-payment-verification-spv; Courtois, N.T., Emirdag, P., Nagy, D.A., Could bitcoin transactions be 100x faster?

However, the challenge in predicting the Bitcoin exchange rate is its high volatility. Therefore, the prediction of its behavior is of great importance for financial markets. In this way, recent studies have been carried out on what internal and/or external Bitcoin information is relevant to its prediction. The increased use of machine learning techniques to predict time series and the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as financial instruments motivated the present study to seek more accurate predictions for the Bitcoin exchange rate. In this way, in a first stage of the proposed methodology, different feature selection techniques were evaluated in order to obtain the most relevant attributes for the predictions. In the sequence, it was analyzed the behavior of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Ensemble algorithms (based on Recurrent Neural Networks and the k-Means clustering method) for price direction predictions. Likewise, the ANN and SVM were employed for regression of the maximum, minimum and closing prices of the Bitcoin. Moreover, the regression results were also used as inputs to try to improve the price direction predictions. The results showed that the selected attributes and the best machine learning model achieved an improvement of more than 10%, in accuracy, for the price direction predictions, with respect to the state-of-the-art papers, using the same period of information. In relation to the maximum, minimum and closing Bitcoin prices regressions, it was possible to obtain Mean Absolute Percentage Errors between 1% and 2%. Based on these results, it was possible to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology when compared to other studies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Attribute selection; Bitcoin; Closing price; Machine learning; Maximum price; Minimum price; Prediction; Price direction; Regression","420298/2016-9

Blockchain technology was first introduced in a whitepaper which went like this: 'Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,' by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Though Blockchain being a completely new field, many companies are trying to implement Blockchain too. A Blockchain contains of a block which contains a hash of cryptography of the previous block, timestamp and transaction data. The main purpose of this project is to create a Proof-Of-Existence of any type of file or record on the platform of Blockchain. Once submitted, we shall be uploading the file's unique signature with its associated information into the Private Decentralized Public Ledger. Records stored here can be extracted later to prove that this particular file existed on particular date time with the associated information uploaded. It is impossible to duplicate the document's signature or modify the past records both technologically and computationally. Therefore POE can be used to prove any file's existence in legal matters. It can also be an important part in any organization which will obviously have records of deals, bonds, customer details, employee details etc which if made to generate a POE for each of them, then will be secure and safe because this is something which cannot be hacked. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; cryptocurrency; POE",,"Paul, G., Sarkar, P., Mukherjee, S., Towards a more democratic mining in bitcoins (2014) Information Systems Security 8880 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science., pp. 185-203. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-13841-111, Prakash A, Shyamasundar R, editors, Springer International Publishing;; Paul, G., Sarkar, P., Mukherjee, S., Towards a more democratic mining in bitcoins (2014) Information Systems Security 8880 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 185-203. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-13841-111K, Prakash A, Shyamasundar R, Springer International Publishing, Elissa, ""Title of paper if known, "" unpublished; Pilkington, M., 2016 Blockchain technology: Principles and applications Research Handbook on Digital Transformations, Social Science Research Network; Peters, G.W., Panayi, E., (2016) Understanding Modern Banking Ledgers Through Blockchain Technologies: Future of Transaction Processing and Smart Contracts on the Internet of Money, pp. 239-278. , Banking Beyond Banks and Money Springer Sep 2016; Maaruf, A., Miraz, M.H., Cloud computing applications (2013) Proceedings of the International Conference on Cloud Computing and EGovernance-ICCCEG 2013, pp. 1-8. , http://www.edlib.asdf.res.in/2013/iccceg/paper001.pdf, Internet City, Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Bajpai, P., (2017) Bitcoin Vs Ethereum Driven by Different Purposes.

Bitcoin transactions usually are confirmed in short periods (minutes), but still much larger than conventional credit card systems (seconds). In this work, we propose a framework encompassing machine learning and a queueing theory model to (i) identify which transactions will be confirmed; and (ii) characterize the confirmation time of confirmed transactions. The proposed queueing theory model accounts for factors such as the activity time of blocks and the mean time between transactions. We parameterize the model for transactions that are confirmed within minutes, suggesting that its integration into a more general framework is a step towards building scalability to Bitcoin.

However, beside of its advantages, blockchain still face several challenges, one of them is scalability. One of the scalability challenges is increasing block size for every new transaction. The size of blockchain reached more than 180 GB. The block size will burden the node in conducting transaction verification. To overcome this problem, this paper has an objective to make summary blocks and compression for the summary blocks so that it can increase the space saving of blockchain and make it easier for nodes to verify transactions. The proposed method used for transactions whose entities can be transferred. This method combines block summarization algorithm and deflate compression algorithm. The proposed method applied to Bitcoin blockchain. Space saving is calculated by comparing the total size of original block with the total size of block that has been summarized and the total size of summary block which has been compressed. From the experiment results, the value of space saving for summary blocks is 22.318% and space saving for summary blocks that have been compressed is 78.104%. © 2018 IEEE.","Bitcoin blockchain; block size; block summarization; deflate algorithm; Scalability",,"Xin, W., Zhang, T., Hu, C., Tang, C., Liu, C., Chen, Z., On scaling and accelerating decentralized private blockchains (2017) IEEE 3rd International Conference on Big Data Security on Cloud, pp. 267-271. , https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7980353/, Beijing, China; Yii-Huumo, J., Ko, D., Choi, S., Park, S., Smolander, K., Where is current research on blockchain technology?-A systematic review (2016) PloS ONE, 11 (10), p. e0163477. , http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0163477, West Virginia University, United States; (2018) Hyperledger, , https://www.hyperledger.org/about/charter, Project Charter from.

This condition raises security problems because of the many violations of security policies. In addition, the development of blockchain is also growing rapidly since it was first popularized in Bitcoin. Security issues on this IoT can be solved using blockchain. One way that can be done is to make secure communication between IoT devices. In this study, an IoT system will be created without and using blockchain which will then be compared between the two. The communication protocol used in IoT systems without blockchain is MQTT. Meanwhile, the blockchain platform used is Ethereum along with a smart contract. Both of these IoT systems will be analyzed for their security level by simulating attacks and observing their security aspects. The test results show that the IoT system based on blockchain technology has a higher level of security than the IoT system without blockchain technology. © 2018 IEEE.","blockchain; ethereum; IoT; smart contract",,"Alam, N., Vats, P., Kashyap, N., Internet of things: A literature review (2017) 2017 Recent Developments in Control, Automation & Power Engineering (RDCAPE), , October; Sorrel, S., (2018) The Internet of Things: Consumer, Industrial & Public Services 2018-2023, , Eds.

On the Bitcoin Blockchain, an owning entity’s real-world identity is hidden behind a pseudonym, a so-called address. Therefore, Bitcoin is widely assumed to provide a high degree of anonymity, which is a driver for its frequent use for illicit activities. This paper presents a novel approach for de-anonymizing the Bitcoin Blockchain by using Supervised Machine Learning to predict the type of yet-unidentified entities. We utilized a sample of 957 entities (with ≈385 million transactions), whose identity and type had been revealed, as training set data and built classifiers differentiating among 12 categories. Our main finding is that we can indeed predict the type of a yet-unidentified entity. Using the Gradient Boosting algorithm with default parameters, we achieve a mean cross-validation accuracy of 80.42% and F1-score of ≈79.64%. We show two examples, one where we predict on a set of 22 clusters that are suspected to be related to cybercriminal activities, and another where we classify 153,293 clusters to provide an estimation of the activity on the Bitcoin ecosystem. We discuss the potential applications of our method for organizational regulation and compliance, societal implications, outline study limitations, and propose future research directions. A prototype implementation of our method for organizational use is included in the appendix. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bitcoin; blockchain; cryptocurrencies; cybercrime; cybersecurity; online anonymity; supervised machine learning",,"Abbasi, A., Albrecht, C., Vance, A., Metafraud, H.J., A meta-learning framework for detecting financial fraud (2012) MIS Quarterly, 36 (4), pp. 1293-1327. , and; Abbasi, A., Chen, H., Nunamaker, J.F., Stylometric identification in electronic markets: Scalability and robustness (2008) Journal of Management Information Systems, 25 (1), pp. 49-78. , and; Abbasi, A., Zahedi, F.M., Zeng, D., Chen, Y., Chen, H., J.F, N.J., Enhancing predictive analytics for anti-phishing by exploiting website genre information (2015) Journal of Management Information Systems, 4 (31), pp. 109-157. , and; Abbasi, A., Zhang, Z., Zimbra, D., Chen, H., J.F, N.J., Detecting fake websites: The contribution of statistical learning theory (2010) MIS Quarterly, 3 (34), pp. 435-461. , and; Ajello, N.J., Fitting a square peg in a round hole: Bitcoin, money laundering, and the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination (2014) Brooklyn Law Review, 80 (2), pp. 435-461; Ali, S.T., Clarke, D., McCorry, P., Christianson, B., Švenda, P., Matyáš, V., Malcolm, J., Anderson, J., Lecture Notes in Computer Science (2015) Security Protocols XXIII.

Supplemented by the convenience offered by the smartphones, an increasing number of users are adopting Bitcoin wallet apps for different purposes. In this paper, we focus on identifying user activities on smartphone-based Bitcoin wallet apps that are commonly used for sending, receiving, and trading Bitcoin. To accomplish our goal, we performed network traffic analysis using machine learning techniques. Since we focus on apps of the same type/functionality, it makes our classification problem even more difficult compared to classifying apps tailored for discrete purposes. Moreover, our goal is to identify user activities even in the presence of encryption. In our experiments, we considered the worldwide most downloaded Bitcoin wallet apps on both Google Play Store and Apple's App Store. For collecting network traffic traces, we used only physical hardware and omitted any emulator to build our experiment scenario as close to the real environment as possible. We process the traffic traces in several phases before extracting the features that are utilized to train our supervised learning algorithms. We deal with the classification problem in multiple stages in a hierarchical fashion. We ran a thorough set of experiments to assess the performance of our system and attained nearly 95% accuracy in user activity identification. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Android; Bitcoin; IOS; Machine learning; Traffic analysis","ICI+/2014/342-896, 2017-166478 (3696","Alan, H.F., Kaur, J., Can android applications be identified using only TCP/IP headers of their launch time traffic?

However, it has been widely reported that it can be used for investment scams, which are referred to as high yield investment programs (HYIP). Although from the security forensic point of view it is very important to identify the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses, so far in the open technical literature no systematic method which reliably collects and identifies such Bitcoin addresses has been proposed. In this paper, a novel methodology is introduced, which efficiently collects a large number of the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses and identifies them based upon a novel analysis of their transactions history. In particular, a scraping-based method is first proposed which is able to collect more than 2,000 HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses from the Internet thus providing a large number of the HYIPs' samples. Second, a supervised machine learning technique, which classifies, whether or not, specific Bitcoin addresses belong to the HYIP operators, is introduced and its performance is evaluated. The proposed classification method is based upon two novel approaches, namely the rate conversion technique that mitigates the effect of Bitcoin price volatility and the sampling technique that reduces the computational amount without sacrificing the classification performance. By employing close to 30,000 real Bitcoin addresses, extensive performance evaluation results obtained by means of computer simulation experiments have shown that the proposed methodology achieves excellent performance, i.e., 95% of the HYIP addresses can be correctly classified, while maintaining a false positive rate less than 4.9%. In order to further validate the proposed classifier's ability to detect the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses, our designed classifier has been tested against a recently published list of the HYIP addresses maintaining its excellent detection accuracy by achieving a 93.75% success rate. © 2013 IEEE.","Bitcoin; blockchain analysis; data mining; forensics; HYIP (high yield investment programs)","JP18K18162","Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, , https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf, Working Paper; Vasek, M., Moore, T., There's no free lunch, even using Bitcoin: Tracking the popularity and profits of virtual currency scams (2015) Proc.

The innovative genetic algorithm is implanted in a complex deep learning structure that emulates the human brain: Reinforcement Learning takes fast and local decisions, Deep Learning Clusters provide identity and memory, Deep Learning Management Clusters take final strategic decisions and finally Genetic Learning transmits the learned information to future generations. This structure has been applied and validated in Fintech, a Bitcoin Smart Investment application based in an Intelligent Banker that performs Buy and Sell decisions on several Cryptocurrencies with an associated exchange and risk. Our results are promising; we have connected the human brain and genetics with Machine Learning based on the Random Neural Network model where Artificial Intelligence, similar as biology, is learning gradually and continuously while adapting to the environment. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Bitcoin; Deep learning clusters; Fintech; Genetic learning; Random neural network; Reinforcement learning; Smart investment",,"Kirschner, M., Gerhart, J., (2005) The Plausibility of Life Resolving Darwin’s Dilemma, , Yale University Press, New Haven; Parter, M., Kashtan, N., Alon, U., Facilitated Variation: How Evolution Learns from Past Environments To Generalize to New Environments (2008) Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science; Hinton, G., Nowlan, S., (1996) How Learning Can Guide Evolution.

Themodified model of Binary Auto Regressive Tree (BART) is adapted from thestandard models of regression trees and the data of the time series. BARTcombines the classic algorithm classification and regression trees (C&RT) andautoregressive models ARIMA. Using the BART model, we made a short-termforecast (from 5 to 30 days) for the 3 most capitalized cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin,Ethereum and Ripple. We found that the proposed approach was more accuratethan the ARIMA-ARFIMA models in forecasting cryptocurrencies time seriesboth in the periods of slow rising (falling) and in the periods of transitiondynamics (change of trend). © 2019 CEUR-WS.

Since the cryptocurrency is generated and consumed by the Blockchain system, it has been considered that Blockchain-specific information would be the main components in predicting cryptocurrency prices. Specifically, this point of view has been largely employed in the studies of Bitcoin price predictions. However, this study recognizes that Ethereum, a popular and leading cryptocurrency in the market, has distinct Blockchain information as compared to that of Bitcoin. We attempt to investigate the relationships between inherent Ethereum Blockchain information and Ethereum prices. Furthermore, the research examines how Blockchain information of other coins in the market is associated with Ethereum prices. The results of data analysis show that Ethereum Blockchain information and Blockchain information of other coins have strong correlations with the final Ethereum prices. © 2019 Association for Information Systems.

Among them. Cryptocurrency system, which is an element of Blockchain teclmology, is a very important factor for operating Blockchain. While Blockchain cryptocurrency has attracted attention, studies on cryptocurrency prices have been mainly conducted, however previous studies mainly conducted on Bitcoin prices. On the other hand, in the context of the creation and trading of various cryptocurrencies based on the Blockchain system, little research has been done on cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. Hence, this study attempts to find variables related to the prices of Dash. Litecoin. and Monero cryptocurrencies using machine learning techniques. We also attempt to find differences in the variables related to die prices for each cryptocurrencies and to examine machine learning techniques that can provide better performance. Research design, data, and methodology: This study performed Dash. Litecoin, and Monero price prediction analysis of cryptocurrency using Blockchain information and machine learning techniques. We employed number of transactions in Blockchain, amount of generated cryptocurrency, transaction fees, number of activity accounts in Blockchain. Block creation difficulty, block size, umber of created blocks as independent variables. This study tried to ensure the reliability of the analysis results through 10-fold cross validation. Blockchain information was hierarchically added for price prediction, and the analysis result was measured as RMSE and MAPE. Results: The analysis shows that the prices of Dash. Litecoin and Monero cryptocurrency are related to Blockchain information. Also, we found that different Blockchain information improves the analysis results for each cryptocurrency. In addition, this study found that the neural network machine learning technique provides better analysis results than support-vector machine in predicting cryptocurrency prices. Conclusion: This study concludes that the information of Blockchain should be considered for the prediction of the price of Dash. Litecoin, and Monero cryptocurrency. It also suggests that Blockchain information related to the price of cryptocurrency differs depending on the type of cryptocurrency. We suggest that future research on various types of cryptocurrencies is needed. The findings of this study can provide a theoretical basis for future cryptocurrency research in distribution management. © Korean Distribution Science Association (KODISA).","Blockchain; Blockchain information; Cryptocurrency; Distribution; Machine learning; Price prediction",,"Antonopoulos, A.M., (2014) Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking digital cryptocurrencies, , O'Reilly Media, Inc; Antonopoulos, A.M., Wood, G., (2018) Mastering ethereum: Building smart contracts and dapps, , O'Reilly Media, Inc; Ciaian, P., Rajcaniova, M., Kancs, D.A., The economics of Bitcoin price formation (2016) Applied Economics, 48 (19), pp. 1799-1815; Cortes, C., Vápnik, V., Support-vector networks (1995) Machine Learning, 20 (3), pp. 273-297; Dang, T.T., Current situation of cryptocurrency in Vietnam (2019) The Journal of Business, Economics, and Environmental Studies, 9 (4), pp. 29-34; Farajnejad, E., Lau, W.Y., A fuzzy based early warning system to predict banking distress on selected Asia-Pacific countries (2017) The Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business, 4 (1), pp. 39-49; Huang, W., Nakamori, Y., Wang, S.Y., Forecasting stock market movement direction with support vector machine (2005) Computers & Operations Research, 32 (10), pp. 2513-2522; Jang, H., Lee, J., An empirical study on modeling and prediction of Bitcoin prices with bayesian neural networks based on Blockchain information (2018) IEEE Access, 6 (1), pp. 5427-5437; Kara, Y., Boyacioglu, M.A., Baykan, O.K., Predicting direction of stock price index movement using artificial neural networks and support vector machines: The sample of the Istanbul Stock Exchange (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 38 (5), pp. 5311-5319; Kshetri, N., Blockchain and the economics of food safety (2019) IT Professional, 21 (3), pp. 63-66; Kuo, T.T., Kim, H.E., Ohno-Machado, L., Blockchain distributed ledger technologies for biomedical and health care applications (2017) Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 24 (6), pp. 1211-1220; Mallqui, D.C., Fernandes, R.A., Predicting the direction, maximum, minimum and closing prices of daily Bitcoin exchange rate using machine learning techniques (2019) Applied Soft Computing, 75 (1), pp. 596-606; Murphy, K.P., (2012) Machine learning: A probabilistic perspective, , Cambridge, MA, USA: MIT Press; Park, Y.E., Chaffar, S., Kim, M.S., Ko, H.Y., Predicting Arab consumers' preferences on the Korean contents distribution (2017) Journal of Distribution Science, 15 (4), pp. 33-40; Tsai, C.F., Wu, J.W., Using neural network ensembles for bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring (2008) Expert Systems with Applications, 34 (4), pp. 2639-2649; Wang, P., Pricing currency options with support vector regression and stochastic volatility model with jumps (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 38 (1), pp. 1-7; Wu, H., Li, Z., King, B., Ben Miled, Z., Wassick, J., Tazelaar, J., A distributed ledger for supply chain physical distribution visibility (2017) Information, 8 (4), pp. 1-18",,"Korea Distribution Science Association (KODISA)","Korean",Article,"Final",Scopus

It is not a priori clear what the aggregation period should be in case of continuously traded cryptocurrencies at online exchanges. In this work, we aggregate RV values using minute-sampled Bitcoin returns over 3-h intervals. Next, using the RV time series, we predict the future values based on the past samples using a plethora of machine learning methods, ANN (MLP, GRU, LSTM), SVM, and Ridge Regression, which are compared to the Heterogeneous Auto-Regressive Realized Volatility (HARRV) model with optimized lag parameters. It is shown that Ridge Regression performs the best, which supports the auto-regressive dynamics postulated by HARRV model. Mean Squared Error values by the neural-network based methods closely follow, whereas the SVM shows the worst performance.

Computational games arise in electronic money systems such as Bitcoin, in cryptographic protocols, and in the study of generative adversarial networks in machine learning. Assuming that one-way functions exist, we prove that there is 2-player zero-sum computational game (Formula Presented) such that, for all n, the size of the action space in (Formula Presented) is polynomial in n and the utility function in (Formula Presented) is computable in time polynomial in n, and yet there is no (Formula Presented) -Nash equilibrium if players are restricted to using strategies computable by polynomial-time Turing machines, where we use a notion of Nash equilibrium that is tailored to computational games. We also show that an (Formula Presented) -Nash equilibrium may not exist if players are constrained to perform at most T computational steps in each of the games in the sequence. On the other hand, we show that if players can use arbitrary Turing machines to compute their strategies, then every computational game has an (Formula Presented) -Nash equilibrium. These results may shed light on competitive settings where the availability of more running time or faster algorithms can lead to a “computational arms race”, precluding the existence of equilibrium. They also point to inherent limitations of concepts such as “best response” and Nash equilibrium in games with resource-bounded players. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bounded rationality; Nash equilibrium; Turing machines",,"Ben-Sasson, E., Tauman-Kalai, A., Kalai, E., An approach to bounded rationality (2007) Proceedings of the 19Th Neural Information Processing Systems Conference, pp. 145-152; Brassard, G., Chaum, D., Crépeau, C., Minimum disclosure proofs of knowledge (1988) J.

By using the developed formal model and the performed critical analysis of methods and technologies for predicting the exchange rate of cryptocurrency, we have built a general architecture of the content processing system that acquires data from different cryptocurrency Internet stock exchanges. General functional requirements to the intelligent cryptocurrency system that target the Internet users have been stated. We have investigated methods, models, and tools to improve the effective support for developing structural elements in the model of a decision support system that manages content according to the user's needs. general architectures of the backend and frontend parts of an intelligent cryptocurrency system have been devised. We also developed software for the system of integration and generation of content considering the cryptocurrency needs of users. An analysis of results of experimental verification of the proposed method for content integration and generation taking into consideration the cryptocurrency needs of users has been performed. A special feature of the system is that it analyzes information from social media and builds a forecast of currency rates based on the acquired information. A given system makes it possible to guess the trend in an exchange rate fluctuation. Conferences of a particular cryptocurrency, new implementations, government decrees from different countries, affect a trend as well, so it too must be taken into consideration. In order to account for most cases, it is necessary to constantly accumulate information on the subject and to assign it to Tables in a database. A given process takes place using a specialized software bot that collects and indexes information. The system is characterized by the following features that favorably distinguish it from analogs: the speed of page generation; the presence of SSL certificate and TLS encryption; content of better quality as it is updated every minute; there are no inactive sections of the service; the mobile web-site layout does not copy content at subdomain; automated checks against e-mail spam messages on the exchange rate. The focus of the system is on the frequency of updates at the speed of data aggregation from the Internet stock exchanges and social networks. © 2019, V. Lytvyn, V. Vysotska, V. Kuchkovskiy, I.

Active global crypto currency market growth ""overwhelming"" national economic systems contributes to the formation of a new type of economic relations which makes supply chain as the crucial factor in development. Despite the fact that at the current time in the world community a single (unified) approach to the legal regulation of the crypto currency market has not yet been developed, crypto currency is considered by many world regulators as a promising tool in the monetary policy of national economies. In this regard, it seems extremely urgent to solve the problem which reveals the features of the studied market development, as well as the possibility of its forecasting for short- and medium-term periods of time. The research subject is the process of economic and mathematical modelling of time series characterizing the bitcoin exchange rate volatility, based on the use of artificial neural networks. The purpose of the work is to search and scientifically substantiate the tools and mechanisms for developing prognostic estimates of the crypto currency market development. The paper considers the task of financial time series trend forecasting using the LSTM neural network for supply chain strategies. The time series composed of the BTC / USD currency pair data is analysed; the period analysed is a day. The authors analysed the neural network architecture, built a neural network model taking into account the heterogeneity and random volatility of the time series, developed and implemented an algorithm for solving the problem in the Python system. For training the neural network, data were used for the period from September 24, 2013, to March 17, 2019 (a total of 2002 data sets). The experiment boils down to that the constructed neural network model is trying to determine the trend of the time series for one next timeframe. The training was conducted with a ""teacher"". To determine the prediction error, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was calculated. The results of the study are of practical interest for both government authorities in the field of crypto currency market regulation and for representatives of the business community, who are integrated or planning to integrate into the global crypto currency transaction system. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Artificial neural networks; Forecasting; LSTM; Machine learning; Supply chain management; The architecture of artificial neural networks; Time series",,"Arkhangelskaya, E.V., Kadurin, A., Nikolenko, S.I., Deep Learning.

Ability to understand which factors drive the fluctuations of the Bitcoin price and to what extent they are predictable is interesting both from the theoretical and practical perspective. In this paper, we study the problem of the Bitcoin short-term volatility forecasting based on volatility history and order book data. Order book, consisting of buy and sell orders over time, reflects the intention of the market and is closely related to the evolution of volatility. We propose temporal mixture models capable of adaptively exploiting both volatility history and order book features. By leveraging rolling and incremental learning and evaluation procedures, we demonstrate the prediction performance of our model as well as studying the robustness, in comparison to a variety of statistical and machine learning baselines. Meanwhile, our temporal mixture model enables to decipher the time-varying effect of order book features on volatility. It demonstrates the prospect of our temporal mixture model as an interpretable forecasting framework over heterogeneous Bitcoin data. © 2018 IEEE.","Cryptocurrency; Deep learning; Machine learning; Mixture models; Prediction modes; Robustness","654024","Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System, , http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf; Næs, R., Skjeltorp, J.A., Order book characteristics and the volume-volatility relation: Empirical evidence from a limit order market (2006) Journal of Financial Markets, 9, pp. 408-432; Hansen, P.R., Lunde, A., A forecast comparison of volatility models: Does anything beat a GARCH (1, 1) (2005) Journal of Applied Econometrics, 20, pp. 873-889; Amjad, M., Shah, D., Trading bitcoin and online time series prediction (2017) NIPS 2016 Time Series Workshop, pp. 1-15; Li, T.R., Chamrajnagar, A.S., Fong, X.R., Rizik, N.R., Fu, F., (2018) Sentiment-based Prediction of Alternative Cryptocurrency Price Fluctuations Using Gradient Boosting Tree Model; Kim, Y.B., Kim, J.G., Kim, W., Im, J.H., Kim, T.H., Kang, S.J., Kim, C.H., Predicting fluctuations in cryptocurrency transactions based on user comments and replies (2016) PloS One, 11; Jang, H., Lee, J., An empirical study on modeling and prediction of bitcoin prices with Bayesian neural networks based on blockchain information (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 5427-5437; Katsiampa, P., Volatility estimation for bitcoin: A comparison of GARCH models (2017) Economics Letters, 158, pp. 3-6; Zhang, L., Aggarwal, C., Qi, G.-J., Stock price prediction via discovering multi-frequency trading patterns (2017) SIGKDD.

One of the typical scams that operate on Bitcoin are the so-called Ponzi schemes. These are fraudulent investments which repay users with the funds invested by new users that join the scheme, and implode when it is no longer possible to find new investments. Despite being illegal in many countries, Ponzi schemes are now proliferating on Bitcoin, and they keep alluring new victims, who are plundered of millions of dollars. We apply data mining techniques to detect Bitcoin addresses related to Ponzi schemes. Our starting point is a dataset of features of real-world Ponzi schemes, that we construct by analysing, on the Bitcoin blockchain, the transactions used to perform the scams. We use this dataset to experiment with various machine learning algorithms, and we assess their effectiveness through standard validation protocols and performance metrics. The best of the classifiers we have experimented can identify most of the Ponzi schemes in the dataset, with a low number of false positives. © 2018 IEEE.","Bitcoin; Data mining; Fraud detection",,"Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System, , https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf; Bonneau, J., Miller, A., Clark, J., Narayanan, A., Kroll, J.A., Felten, E.W., SoK: Research perspectives and challenges for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies (2015) IEEE S &P, pp. 104-121; Reid, F., Harrigan, M., An analysis of anonymity in the Bitcoin system (2013) Security and Privacy in Social Networks, pp. 197-223. , Springer; Meiklejohn, S., Pomarole, M., Jordan, G., Levchenko, K., McCoy, D., Voelker, G.M., Savage, S., A fistful of bitcoins: Characterizing payments among men with no names (2013) Internet Measurement Conference.

However, in addition to the prediction properties the model producer aims to share, there is also a risk that the model consumer can infer other properties of the training data the model producer did not intend to share. In this paper, we focus on the inference of global properties of the training data, such as the environment in which the data was produced, or the fraction of the data that comes from a certain class, as applied to white-box Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs). Because of their complexity and inscrutability, FCNNs have a particularly high risk of leaking unexpected information about their training sets; at the same time, this complexity makes extracting this information challenging. We develop techniques that reduce this complexity by noting that FCNNs are invariant under permutation of nodes in each layer. We develop our techniques using representations that capture this invariance and simplify the information extraction task. We evaluate our techniques on several synthetic and standard benchmark datasets and show that they are very effective at inferring various data properties. We also perform two case studies to demonstrate the impact of our attack. In the first case study we show that a classifier that recognizes smiling faces also leaks information about the relative attractiveness of the individuals in its training set. In the second case study we show that a classifier that recognizes Bitcoin mining from performance counters also leaks information about whether the classifier was trained on logs from machines that were patched for the Meltdown and Spectre attacks. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Neural networks; Permutation equivalence; Property inference","CNS 13-30491, CNS 14-08944

These yield large amount of data. A good analysis of these data can lead to new knowledge about the present situation as well as the future insight. While many advantages could be obtained from these large data, the issue on how to run the Machine Learning on a large dataset as effective and efficient as possible remains an open problem. In this paper, data processing simulation using machine learning algorithm ofLinear Regression is conducted to learn from Bitcoin trading dataset. The simulation is carried out in Apache Spark cluster architecture and GPU. The running time and error of the algorithm implementation in both architectures are compared with each other. The simulation results show similar error performance between Apache Spark cluster and GPU.

Notably, our work is motivated by the high energy consumption for mining PoW, and we want to restrict the use of PoW to a configurable, expected size of nodes, as a function of the local blockchain state. The approach we develop for this rests on three pillars: (i) Proof of Kernel Work (PoKW), a means of dynamically reducing the set of nodes that can participate in the solving of PoW puzzles such that an adversary cannot increase his attack surface because of such a reduction; (ii) Practical Adaptation of Existing Technology, a realization of this PoW reduction through an adaptation of existing blockchain and enterprise technology stacks; and (iii) Machine Learning for Adaptive System Resiliency, the use of techniques from artificial intelligence to make our approach adaptive to system, network and attack dynamics. We develop here, in detail, the first pillar and illustrate the second pillar through a real use case, a pilot project done with Porsche on controlling permissions to vehicle and data log accesses. We also discuss pertinent attack vectors for PoKW consensus and their mitigation. Moreover, we sketch how our approach may lead to more democratic PoKW-based blockchain systems for public networks that may inherit the resilience of blockchains based on PoW. © 2018 The Authors.

We monitor the change in the activities over time and relate them to economic theories. We identify key network features that determine the demand and supply dynamics of a crypto currency.

The prediction model with include the least error is obtained by testing with different parameter combinations such as SVM with including linear and polynomial kernel functions. Filters with different weight coefficients are used for different window lengths. For different window lengths, Bitcoin price prediction is made using filters with different weight coefficients. 10-fold cross-validation method in training phase is used in order to construct a model with high performance independent of the data set. The performance of the obtained model is measured by means of statistical indicators such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Pearson Correlation. It is seen that the price prediction performance of the proposed SVM model for Bitcoin data set is higher than that of the LR model. © 2018 IEEE.","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; Machine Learning; Price Prediction; Support Vector Machine (SVM)",,"Çarkacioǧlu, A., Kripto-para-bitcoin (2016) Sermaye Piyasasi Kurulu: Araştirma Raporu, pp. 1-73; Madan, I., Saluja, S., Zhao, A., Automated bitcoin trading via machine learning algorithms (2015) Tech.

This paper proposes solutions to assist law enforcement agencies in piecing together the disparate and complex technical, behavioural and criminological elements that make up cybercriminal offending. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review was conducted to highlight the main law enforcement challenges and discussions and examine current discourse in the areas of anonymity and attribution. The paper also looked at other research and projects that aim to identify illicit transactions involving cryptocurrencies and the darknet. Findings: An optimal solution would be one which has a predictive capability and a machine learning architecture which automatically collects and analyses data from the Bitcoin blockchain and other external data sources and applies search criteria matching, indexing and clustering to identify suspicious behaviours. The implementation of a machine learning architecture would help improve results over time and would be less manpower intensive. Cyber investigators would also receive intelligence in a format and language that they understand and it would allow for intelligence-led and predictive policing rather than reactive policing. The optimal solution would be one which allows for intelligence-led, predictive policing and enables and encourages information sharing between multiple stakeholders from the law enforcement, financial intelligence units, cyber security organisations and fintech industry. This would enable the creation of red flags and behaviour models and the provision of up-to-date intelligence on the threat landscape to form a viable intelligence product for law enforcement agencies so that they can more easily get to the who, what, when and where. Originality/value: The development of a functional software architecture that, in theory, could be used to detected suspicious illicit transactions on the Bitcoin network. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Anonymity; Bitcoin blockchain; Heuristics; Illicit transactions; Law enforcement; Red flag indicators",,"Androulaki, E., Karame, G.O., Roeschlin, M., Scherer, T., Capkun, S., Evaluating user privacy in bitcoin (2013) Financial Cryptography and Data Security, pp. 34-51; (2016) International operation targets users of Darknet marketplaces, , www.afp.gov.au/news-media/media-releases/international-operation-targets-users-darknet-marketplaces, (accessed, Press Release on 1 November 2016: 29 June 2017; (2016) Backing Australian fintech, Australia’s fintech priorities, , https://fintech.treasury.gov.au/australias-fintech-priorities/, (accessed: 21 June 2017; (2016) Supporting Australia’s fintech future, , http://sjm.ministers.treasury.gov.au/media-release/032-2016/, (accessed: 26 June 2017; Bednar, P.M., Katos, V., A cyber-crime investigation framework (2008) Computer Standards & Interfaces, 30 (4), pp. 223-228; Beebe, N.L., Clark, J.G., A hierarchical, object-based framework for the digital investigation process (2005) Digital Investigation, 2 (2), pp. 147-167; Bonneau, J., Miller, A., Clark, J., Narayanan, A., Kroll, J.A., Felten, E.W., SoK: research perspectives and challenges for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies (2015) IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 104-121; Camenisch, J., Hohenberger, S., Lysyanskaya, A., Compact e- cash (2005) Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT, pp. 302-321. , Springer, Berlin Heidelberg; Carrier, B., Spafford, E.H., (2003) An event-based digital forensic investigation framework, , www.dfrws.org/2004/day1/Carrier-event.pdf, (accessed: 28 June 2017; Carrier, B., Spafford, E.H., Categories of digital investigation analysis techniques based on the computer history model (2006) , Digital Investigations, 3S, pp. S121-S130; Casey, E., (2003) Digital Evidence and Computer Crime – Forensic Science, Computers and the Internet, , Elsevier Academic Press, Cambridge; Chaum, D., Blind signature for untraceable payments (1982) Advances in Cryptology-Eurocrypt, 82, pp. 199-203. , Plenum Press, New York, NY; (2014) Crypto-currency market capitalizations, , https://coinmarketcap.com/, (accessed: 12 December2014; (2015) Crypto-currency market capitalizations, , https://coinmarketcap.com, (accessed: 15 July 2015; (2017) Crypto-currency market capitalizations, , https://coinmarketcap.com/, (accessed: 19 June 2017; (2017) European union launches ‘Titanium’ project investigating criminal use of bitcoin and dark web, , https://darknetmarkets.co/european-union-launches-titanium-project-investigating-criminal-use-of-bitcoin-and-dark-web/, (accessed: 15 July 2017; Eskandari, S., Barrera, D., Stobert, E., Clark, J., A first look at the usability of bitcoin key management (2015) Workshop on Usable Security (USEC), pp. 1-12; Farghaly, M., (2014) Bitcoin Programming, , 1st Ed., CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform; (2017) Intelligence primer, , www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/intelligence-branch, (accessed: 28 February 2017; Fleder, M., Kester, M.S., Pillai, S., (2015) Bitcoin transaction graph analysis, , https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01657.pdf, (accessed: 4 July 2017; (2017) Wannacry, the biggest ransomware outbreak ever, , https://safeandsavvy.f-secure.com/2017/05/12/wannacry-may-be-the-biggest-cyber-outbreak-since-conficker/, (accessed: 28 June 2017; Gamer, N., (2015) What lies beneath: the deep web and future crimes, , http://blog.trendmicro.com/what-lies-beneath-the-deep-web-and-future-crimes/, (accessed: 28 June 2017; Gerstein, I.R., Hervieux-Payette, C., (2015) Digital Currency: You Can’t Flip This Coin!

Statistics from Twitter support this statement where, approximately 1,500 Tweets about Bitcoin alone is recorded per hour. Consequently, many people are beginning to become more aware and accepting of the nature of digital currencies, and traders in particular seek to know how they can make profitable crypto-coin trades and investments. Although a number of research projects have been undertaken to develop systems that can effectively predict price movements in the cryptocurrency market, they display significant efficiency gaps, which this paper further explores. The authors then attempt to learn from past studies and construct a more holistic approach to a predictive price model for the cryptocurrency market. This focuses on assessing key factors that affect the volatility of the market - public perception, trading data, historic price data, and the interdependencies between Bitcoin and Altcoins - and how they can be best utilized from a technological aspect by applying sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques, to increase the efficiency of the process. © 2018 IEEE.","Cryptocurrency Price Prediction; Machine Learning; Predictive Models; Sentiment Analysis",,"30 Bitcoin Hashtags Popular on Twitter | RiteTag: Find the Best Hashtags, , https://ritetag.com/best-hashtags-for/bitcoin, Accessed: 2017-12-20; D'Alfonso, A., Peter Langer, Z.V., The future of cryptocurrency (2016) International Security, 7 (5), pp. 7-45; Anantwar, S.G., Shelke, R.R., Simplified approach of ann: Strengths and weakness (2012) International Journal of Engineering and Innovative Technology (IJEIT), 1 (4), pp. 73-77; Byvatov, E., Comparison of support vector machine and artificial neural network systems for drug/nondrug classification (2003) Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling., 43 (6), pp. 1882-1889. , https://doi.org/10.1021/ci0341161; Ciaian, P., (2016) Virtual Relationships: Short-and Long-run Evidence from BitCoin and Altcoin Markets.; CryptoCurrency Market Capitalizations, , https://coinmarketcap.com/, Accessed: 2017-07-22; Definitive Portal for Social Media Statistics Globally | Socialbakers, , https://www.socialbakers.com/statistics/, Accessed: 2017-08-28; Ethereum-Explore-Google Trends, , https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=Ethereum, Accessed: 2017-12-17; Greaves, A., Au, B., (2015) Using the Bitcoin Transaction Graph to Predict the Price of Bitcoin.; Joachims, T., Text categorization with support vector machines: Learning with many relevant features (1998) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)., 1398, pp. 137-142. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s13928716, 1998; Kim, B.Y., Predicting fluctuations in cryptocurrency transactions based on user comments and replies (2016) PLoS ONE., 11 (8), pp. 1-17. , https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0161197; Pang, B., Lee, L., (2008) Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis; Patel, J., Predicting stock and stock price index movement using Trend Deterministic Data Preparation and machine learning techniques (2015) Expert Systems with Applications., 42 (1), pp. 259-268. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2014.07.040; Rowlands, J., (2014) Bitcoin Algorithmic Trading Bot, , April 2014; Statnikov, A., A comprehensive comparison of random forests and support vector machines for microarray-based cancer classification (2008) BMC Bioinformatics., 9 (1), p. 319. , https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-9-319; Yang, Y., Webb, G.I., (2001) Proportional K-Interval Discretization for Naive-Bayes Classifiers., pp. 564-575. , 2001",,"IEEE Computer Society","English",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus

The price data is sourced from the Bitcoin Price Index. The task is achieved with varying degrees of success through the implementation of a Bayesian optimised recurrent neural network (RNN) and a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. The LSTM achieves the highest classification accuracy of 52% and a RMSE of 8%. The popular ARIMA model for time series forecasting is implemented as a comparison to the deep learning models. As expected, the non-linear deep learning methods outperform the ARIMA forecast which performs poorly.

Among the other cryptocurrencies available in the market, Bitcoin cryptocurrency is the most valuable and famous currency. A large number of people discuss about the Bitcoin currency on the internet and social media platforms as well. These discussions help in determining the importance of Bitcoin in terms of users’ discussions about Bitcoin and can help in determining the value of Bitcoin in terms of people point of views about the topic. In this paper, sentiment analysis of the tweets of users on the topic of Bitcoin has been carried out. For this purpose, real-world twitter data set of Bitcoins is used. The data set has been divided into five separate sections for better comparative analysis, including overall extensive data analysis regarding tweets, retweets, tweets with mentions, tweets containing external links and also about the users who discuss regarding cryptocurrency of Bitcoin. A framework for sentiment analysis is proposed on the basis of Naïve Bayes sentiment classification algorithms which is widely used as a better option for text data. The proposed framework is capable to perform sentiment analysis of the tweets data. The results resemble that users’ opinions are on the high positive side about Bitcoins and people mostly people represent the positive sentiment about Bitcoins. The results are evaluated using the standard performance evaluation measures including precision, recall, f1- score and accuracy. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Bitcoin; Classification; Machine learning; Naïve bayes; Proposed framework; Sentiment analysis; Users’ opinions",,"Phillips, R.C., Gorse, D., Predicting cryptocurrency price bubbles using social media data and epidemic modelling (2017) 2017 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI), pp. 1-7; Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system; Conti, M.S.K.E., Lal, C., Ruj, S., A Survey on Security and Privacy Issues of Bitcoin (2018) IEEE Commun.

This paper presents a model-less convolutional neural network with historic prices of a set of financial assets as its input, outputting portfolio weights of the set. The network is trained with 0.7 years' price data from a cryptocurrency exchange. The training is done in a reinforcement manner, maximizing the accumulative return, which is regarded as the reward function of the network. Back test trading experiments with trading period of 30 minutes is conducted in the same market, achieving 10-fold returns in 1.8 month's periods. Some recently published portfolio selection strategies are also used to perform the same back tests, whose results are compared with the neural network.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and a decentralized worldwide payment system for digital currency where transactions take place among users without any intermediary. Bitcoin transactions are performed and verified by network nodes and then registered in a public ledger called blockchain, which is maintained by network entities running Bitcoin software. To date, this cryptocurrency is worth close to U.S. $150 billion and widely traded across the world. However, as Bitcoin's popularity grows, many security concerns are coming to the forefront. Overall, Bitcoin security inevitably depends upon the distributed protocols-based stimulant-compatible proof-of-work that is being run by network entities called miners, who are anticipated to primarily maintain the blockchain (ledger). As a result, many researchers are exploring new threats to the entire system, introducing new countermeasures, and therefore anticipating new security trends. In this survey paper, we conduct an intensive study that explores key security concerns. We first start by presenting a global overview of the Bitcoin protocol as well as its major components. Next, we detail the existing threats and weaknesses of the Bitcoin system and its main technologies including the blockchain protocol. Last, we discuss current existing security studies and solutions and summarize open research challenges and trends for future research in Bitcoin security. © 2013 IEEE.","anomaly detection; Bitcoin; blockchain; machine learning (ML); security","1620871, 1620862, 1651280, 1633978","https://bitcoin.org/en/, Bitcoin.

With the power of blockchain technology, P2P exchanges attract many users. The exchange of Bitcoins invites risk, as interactions between users are anonymous. To ensure a safe transaction, it is extremely important to select a trustworthy user before dealing with them. Ascertaining the reputation of the user is very important in preventing counterfeit transactions, minimizing risk, and avoiding illicit users. However, the anonymous nature of the system makes this difficult. A mechanism for evaluating user reputation and fidelity is highly recommended. In this paper, we propose a reputation trust model for a Bitcoin Over the Counter (OTC) platform. The model measures the reputation of Bitcoin users based on filtering outlier values, potentially reducing the effects of malicious users. Out of seven identified factors, we injected five into our model and carried out testing using an unsupervised approach. The Bitcoin- Alpha dataset was used in testing. © 31st International Conference on Computer Applications in Industry and Engineering, CAINE 2018.

In addition, graph analysis and the use of modern social media technology were examined to determine how they may help reveal the identity of Bitcoin users. A review of machine learning techniques and heuristics was carried out to learn how certain behaviours from the Bitcoin network could be augmented with social media technology and other data to identify illicit transactions. Design/methodology/approach-A number of experiments were conducted and time was spend observing the network to ascertain how Bitcoin transactions work, how the Bitcoin protocol operates over the network and what Bitcoin artefacts can be examined from a digital forensics perspective. Packet sniffing software, Wireshark, was used to see whether the identity of a user is revealed when they set up a wallet via an online wallet service. In addition, a block parser was used to analyse the Bitcoin client synchronisation and reveal information on the behaviour of a Bitcoin node when it joins the network and synchronises to the latest blockchain. The final experiment involved setting up and witnessing a transaction using the Bitcoin Client API. These experiments and observations were then used to design a proof of concept and functional software architecture for searching, indexing and analyzing publicly available data flowing from the blockchain and other big data sources. Findings-Using heuristics and graph analysis techniques show us that it is possible to build up a picture of behaviour of Bitcoin addresses and transactions, then utilise existing typologies of illicit behaviour to collect, process and exploit potential red flag indicators. Augmenting Bitcoin data, big data and social media may be used to reveal potentially illicit financial transaction going through the Bitcoin blockchain and machine learning applied to the data sets to rank and cluster suspicious transactions. Originality/value-The development of a functional software architecture that, in theory, could be used to detect suspicious illicit transactions on the Bitcoin network. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoin Blockchain;

Investors are continually seeking new ways to extract meaningful information about the future direction of price changes. Recently, cryptocurrencies have attracted huge attention due to their unique way of transferring value as well as its value as a hedge. A method proposed in this project involves using data mining techniques: mining text documents such as news articles and tweets try to infer the relationship between information contained in such items and cryptocurrency price direction. The Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM RNN) assists in creating a hybrid model which comprises of sentiment analysis techniques, as well as a predictive machine learning model. The success of the model was evaluated within the context of predicting the direction of Bitcoin price changes. Findings reported here reveal that our system yields more accurate and real-time predictions of Bitcoin price fluctuations when compared to other existing models in the market.

A popular approach to this is using Markov switching models. This paper will look at the implementation of Markov switching generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (MSGARCH) models with normal and t-distributed innovations to recent Bitcoin/US Dollar price dynamics, and also show that these can be an improvement over single-regime models of the same kind, by demarcating high and low volatility regimes. Furthermore, we also look at both maximum likelihood estimation, and Bayesian estimation via Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The predictive performance is also analysed using risk management tools such as value-at-risk and expected shortfall, and we show that the two-regime model with t-distributed innovations provides the best fit. © 2018 PDF-CONFERENCE.

Blockchain technology can be used in various ways. Capital transfer, like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is only one possible usage. One important and very interesting property of this technology is decentralisation. In recent decades, projects got larger and more complex. Fewer people were working on a single system and more simple labour was done than complex engineering tasks. Today, more engineers working on one large system than ever. Having this huge projects, complexity rises exponentially. If it werent for advanced computer programs, it wouldn't be possible to fill this demand. Nevertheless, this programs mostly solve simple and rarely more complex tasks. It never solves such huge number of tasks needed in large industrial projects like creating trains or satellites. To plan and maintain this projects can take years of experts working. Defining interfaces, assigning submodules and reacting to changes can delay projects significantly. The way we handle these projects is very similar to the way we did it a century ago and only small changes in its blueprint have been made. Namely, it is heavily centralized. This is not necessarily a bad thing but for scaling up projects sizes more and more, centralized systems getting more and more complex, inefficient and error-prone. The blockchain technology offers a possible solution for this problem. Decentralizing project design and definition might be the key to scale up systems without exponentially increasing complexity. This paper proposes a sample design and certain follow-up possibilities for blockchain based project structures are given. Â© 2018 by the International Astronautical Federation.

It restricts you from using your PC or mobile device, by encrypting your files. Paying ransom (through Bitcoins) however, does not guarantee that you'll get your files back. Prevention is still way better than allowing yourself to be infected and then trying to find a cure. This paper aims at developing a self-learning algorithm using Machine Learning Techniques to detect Ransomware at various stages be it the Initial level, Network level or the Encryption Phase.

The evolving landscape is further influenced by cryptocurrencies: non-fiat, decentralized digital payment systems, like Bitcoin, that operate outside the formal financial sector. While Bitcoin has garnered attention for facilitating criminal activity, including money laundering, terrorism financing, digital ransomware, weapons trafficking, and tax evasion, it is Bitcoin's underlying protocol, the blockchain, that represents an innovation capable of transforming financial services and challenging existing security, financial, and public safety regulations and policies. Canada's challenge is to find the right balance between oversight and innovation. Our paper examines these competing interests: we provide an overview of blockchain technologies, illustrate their potential in Canada and abroad, and examine the government's role in fostering innovation while concurrently bolstering regulations, maintaining public safety, and securing the integrity of financial systems. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; cryptocurrency; disruptive technology; financial regulation; money laundering; terrorism financing",,"Arner, D., Barberis, J., Buckley, R., The evolution of fintech (2016) Georgetown Journal of International Law, 47, pp. 1271-1319; Gabor, D., Brooks, S., The digital revolution in financial inclusion (2017) New Political Economy, 22 (4), pp. 423-426; Nelms, T., Alt.Economy: Ethnographic explorations of alternative economic imaginaries (2016) Journal of Cultural Economy, 9 (5), pp. 508-512; Cerny, P., The dynamics of financial globalization (1994) Policy Sciences, 27, pp. 319-342; Datz, G., Governments as market players (2008) Journal of International Affairs, 62 (1), pp. 35-49; Perez, C., (2002) Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital, , (London: Elgar; Foray, D., Freeman, C., (1993) Technology and The Wealth of Nations: The Dynamics of Constructed Advantage, , (New York: St. Martin’s Press; Huo, J., (2015) How Nations Innovate, , (Oxford: Oxford University Press, esp. chapter five; Wild, J., Arnold, M., Stafford, P., Technology: Banks seek the key to blockchain (2015) Financial Times, 1p; Wilkins, C., Gaetz, G., Could DLT underpin an entire wholesale payment system?

The sheer quantity of ads makes manual exploration and analysis unscalable. In addition, discerning whether an ad is advertising a trafficked victim or an independent sex worker is a very difficult task. Very little concrete ground truth (i.e., ads definitively known to be posted by a trafficker) exists in this space. In this work, we develop tools and techniques that can be used separately and in conjunction to group sex ads by their true owner (and not the claimed author in the ad). Specifically, we develop a machine learning classifier that uses stylometry to distinguish between ads posted by the same vs. different authors with 90% TPR and 1% FPR. We also design a linking technique that takes advantage of leakages from the Bitcoin mempool, blockchain and sex ad site, to link a subset of sex ads to Bitcoin public wallets and transactions. Finally, we demonstrate via a 4-week proof of concept using Backpage as the sex ad site, how an analyst can use these automated approaches to potentially find human traffickers. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,"CNS-1619620

At the time of writing, the Bitcoin ecosystem has not yet been mapped and as such there is no estimate of the share of illicit activities. This paper provides the first estimation of the portion of cyber-criminal entities in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Our dataset consists of 854 observations categorised into 12 classes (out of which 5 are cybercrime-related) and a total of 100,000 uncategorised observations. The dataset was obtained from the data provider who applied three types of clustering of Bitcoin transactions to categorise entities: co-spend, intelligence-based, and behaviour-based. Thirteen supervised learning classifiers were then tested, of which four prevailed with a cross-validation accuracy of 77.38%, 76.47%, 78.46%, 80.76% respectively. From the top four classifiers, Bagging and Gradient Boosting classifiers were selected based on their weighted average and per class precision on the cybercrime-related categories. Both models were used to classify 100,000 uncategorised entities, showing that the share of cybercrime-related is 29.81% according to Bagging, and 10.95% according to Gradient Boosting with number of entities as the metric. With regard to the number of addresses and current coins held by this type of entities, the results are: 5.79% and 10.02% according to Bagging; and 3.16% and 1.45% according to Gradient Boosting. © 2017 IEEE.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Cybercrime; Ecosystem; Machine Learning; Ransomware; Supervised Learning",,"Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System; Cuthbertson, A., Bitcoin now accepted by 100,000 merchants worldwide (2015) International Business Times, , IBTimes Co., Ltd.

The existence and development of blockchain technology make cryptocurrency in recent years believably become a complete alternative to traditional ones. Bitcoin is the world's first peer-to-peer and decentralized digital cash system initiated by Nakamoto [1]. Though being the most prominent cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has not been a legal trading currency in various countries. Its exchange rate has appeared to be an exceptionally high-risk portfolio with extreme volatility, which requires a more detailed evaluation before making any decision. This paper utilizes knowledge of statistics for financial time series and machine learning to (i) fit the parametric distribution and (ii) model and forecast the volatility of Bitcoin returns, and (iii) analyze its correlation to other financial market indicators. The fitted parametric time series model significantly outperforms other standard models in explaining the stylized facts and statistical variances in the behavior of Bitcoin returns. The model forecast also outperforms some machine learning methodologies, which would benefit policy makers, banks and financial investors in trading activities for both long-term and short-term strategies. © 2017 IEEE.","Bitcoin; cryptocurrency; statistical finance; volatility modeling",,"Nakamoto, S., Bitcoin: A Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System, , White Paper; Currency Stats: Bitcoin Currency Statistics, , https://blockchain.info/stats, Blockchain Info [Accessed Apr. 1, 2017]; Yermack, D., (2013) Is Bitcoin A Real Currency?, , An economic appraisal no. w19747, National Bureau of Economic Research, Dec; Hanley, B.P., (2013) The False Premises and Promises of Bitcoin, , arXiv, Dec; Ciaian, P., Rajcaniova, M., Kancs, D.A., The economics of Bitcoin price formation (2016) Applied Economics, 48 (19), pp. 1799-1815. , Apr; Fink, C., Johann, T., (2014) Bitcoin Markets, , SSRN 2408396; Hur, Y., Jeon, S., Yoo, B., (2015) Investigation into the Market Viability of Bitcoin: Measuring the Digital Currency's Speculative Nature, , SSRN 2599953; Garcia, D., Tessone, C.J., Mavrodiev, P., Perony, N., The digital traces of bubbles: Feedback cycles between socio-economic signals in the Bitcoin economy (2014) Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 11 (99), p. 20140623. , Oct; Hayes, A., (2015) A Cost of Production Model for Bitcoin, , SSRN 2580904, Mar; Brandvold, M., Molnár, P., Vagstad, K., Valstad, O.C.A., Price discovery on Bitcoin exchanges (2015) Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 36, pp. 18-35; Bartos, J., Does Bitcoin follow the hypothesis of efficient market?

On the surface, the creation of ASIC clouds may seem highly improbable due to high NREs and the inflexibility of ASICs. Surprisingly, however, large-scale ASIC Clouds have already been deployed widely to implement the distributed Bitcoin cryptocurrency system.Among our contributions, we present a methodology that given an accelerator design, derives Pareto-optimal ASIC cloud Servers, by extracting data from place-and-routed circuits and computational fluid dynamic simulations, and then employing clever but brute-force search to find the best jointly-optimized ASIC, DRAM subsystem, motherboard, power delivery system, cooling system, operating voltage, and case design. Moreover, we show how data center parameters determine which of the many Pareto-optimal points is TCO-optimal. Finally we examine when it makes sense to build an ASIC Cloud, and examine the impact of ASIC NRE.

All history of Bitcoins owning and transferring (addresses and transactions) is available as a public ledger called blockchain. But real-world owners of addresses are not known in general. That's why Bitcoin is called pseudo-anonymous. However, some addresses can be grouped by their ownership using behavior patterns and publicly available information from off-chain sources. Blockchain-based common behavior pattern analysis (common spending and one-time change heuristics) is widely used for Bitcoin clustering as votes for addresses association, while offchain information (tags) is mostly used to verify results. In this paper, we propose to use off-chain information as votes for address separation and to consider it together with blockchain information during the clustering model construction step. Both blockchain and off-chain information are not reliable, and our approach aims to filter out errors in input data. The results of the study show the feasibility of a proposed approached for Bitcoin address clustering. It can be useful for the users to avoid insecure Bitcoin usage patterns and for the investigators to conduct a more advanced de-anonymizing analysis. © 2017 IEEE.","Bitcoin,-blockchain,-clustering,-privacy,-anonymity","14-50-00150","Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System, , https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf; Shen Tu, Q.C., Yu, J.P., (2015) Research On Anonymization and De-anonymization in the Bitcoin System, , https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07782; Reid, F., Harrigan, M., An analysis of anonymity in the Bitcoin system (2011) Proc. 3rd IEEE International Conference On Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust and On Social Computing, SocialCom/PASSAT'11, pp. 1318-1326; Ron, D., Shamir, A., Quantitative analysis of the full bitcoin transaction graph (2012) Cryptology EPrint Archive, Report 2012/584, , http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/584; Conti, M., Lal, C., Ruj, S., (2017) A Survey On Security and Privacy Issues of Bitcoin, , arXiv preprint; Maxwell, G., (2013) Coin Join: Bitcoin Privacy for the Real World, , https://bitcointalk.org/index.phptopic=279249.0; Maxwell, G., (2013) Coin Swap: Transaction Graph Disjoint Trustless Trading, , https://bitcointalk.org/index.phptopic=321228.0; Bonneau, J., Mixcoin: Anonymity for Bitcoin with accountable mixes (2014) Proc. 18th International Conference On Financial Cryptography and Data Security, FC'14, p. 486504; Yanovich, Y., (2016) Shared Send Untangling in Bitcoin, , http://bitfury.com/content/5-white-papers-research/bitfurywhitepaper/shared/senduntanglingin/itcoin/8,24,2016.pdf; Qing Chun, S.T., Jian Ping, Y., (2015) Transaction Remote Release (TRR): A New Anonymization Technology for Bitcoin, , http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06160v1; Ben-Sasson, E., (2014) Zerocash: Decentralized Anonymous Payments from Bitcoin (Extended Version), , https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/349, Cryptology ePrint Archive, Report 2014/349; Kaminsky, D., (2011) Black Ops of TCP/IP, p. 44. , Black Hat USA; Biryukov, A., Pustogarov, I., Bitcoin over tor isn't a good idea (2015) Security and Privacy (SP), 2015 IEEE Symposium On, pp. 122-134. , IEEE; Harrigan, M., Fretter, C., The unreasonable effectiveness of address clustering (2016) Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced and Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing and Communications, Cloud and Big Data Computing, Internet of People, and Smart World Congress (UIC/ATC/ScalCom/CBDCom/IoP/SmartWorld), 2016 Intl IEEE Conferences, pp. 368-373. , IEEE; Meiklejohn, S., A fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing payments among men with no names (2013) Proc. 2013 Internet Measurement Conference, IMC'13, pp. 127-140; Fleder, M., Kester, M.S., Pillai, S., (2015) Bitcoin Transaction Graph Analysis, , arXiv preprint; Androulaki, E., Evaluating user privacy in bitcoin (2013) International Conference On Financial Cryptography and Data Security, pp. 34-51. , Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg; Monaco, J., Identifying bitcoin users by transaction behavior (2015) Proc.

The graph represents the interaction between entities, and the neighborhood of each entity contains information that allows the inferences or predictions. We present an approach for applying machine learning directly to such graph neighborhoods, yielding predictions for graph nodes on the basis of the structure of their local neigh-borhood and the features of the nodes in it. Our approach allows predictions to be learned direcdy from examples, bypassing the step of creating and tuning an inference model or summarizing the neighborhoods via a fixed set of handcrafted features. The approach is based on a multi-level architecture built from Long Short-Term Memory neural nets (LSTMs); the LSTMs leam how to summarize the neighborhood from data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique on a synthetic example and on real-world data related to crowdsourced grading, Bitcoin transactions, and Wikipedia edit reversions. © Copyright 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

It refers to the network of computers, laptops, mobile devices or tablets which is remotely controlled by the cybercriminals to initiate various distributed coordinated attacks including spam emails, ad-click fraud, Bitcoin mining, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), disseminating other malwares and much more. Likewise traditional PC based botnet, Mobile botnets have the same operational impact except the target audience is particular to smartphone users. Therefore, it is import to uncover this security issue prior to its widespread adaptation. We propose SMARTbot, a novel dynamic analysis framework augmented with machine learning techniques to automatically detect botnet binaries from malicious corpus. SMARTbot is a component based off-device behavioral analysis framework which can generate mobile botnet learning model by inducing Artificial Neural Networks' back-propagation method. Moreover, this framework can detect mobile botnet binaries with remarkable accuracy even in case of obfuscated program code. The results conclude that, a classifier model based on simple logistic regression outperform other machine learning classifier for botnet apps' detection, i. e 99.49% accuracy is achieved. Further, from manual inspection of botnet dataset we have extracted interesting trends in those applications. As an outcome of this research, a mobile botnet dataset is devised which will become the benchmark for future studies. © 2016 Karim et al.

Likewise several reassignment techniques are capturing the attention of researchers in the field of signal analysis. Particularly, the Synchrosqueezing Wavelet Transform - SST allows signal decomposition and instantaneous frequency extrusion, at the same time promising consistent reconstruction capabilities, hence the possibility to contrive an SST assisted inference engine. We are going to test it using datasets extracted from search engine trends, using a cloud of keywords related to the Bitcoin topic. This could be useful to study the evolution of the cryptocurrency both in time and geographical terms, and to estimate the future number of queries. The importance of Bitcoin queries prediction goes beyond the academic and research environments and, as such, it could lead to valuable commercial applications, such as financial recommender systems or blockchain-based transaction managers development. © 2016, CEUR-WS.
